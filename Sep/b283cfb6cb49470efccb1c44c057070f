The Federal Government on Wednesday disclosed plans to unveil the first modular refinery in the country in the first week of November. The refinery, owned by Niger Delta Petroleum Resources, in Ogbele, Rivers State, is expected to refine 10,000 barrel of crude oil daily. The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Niger Delta, Mr Edobor Iyamu, stated this in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, during the opening session of a media workshop on ‘Agenda for the Niger Delta New Vision’. The workshop, which was organised by the Niger Delta New Vision in the Office of the Vice-President, had the theme: ‘Partnership for regional development and nation building’. According to Iyamu, the modular refinery is an upgrade from 1,000 bpd capacity to 10,000 bpd. He also stated that prior to the unveiling of the upgraded refinery in Rivers State in November, a ground-breaking ceremony would be performed by the Presidency for the construction of another 5,000 bpd modular refinery on October 4 in Obigwe, Ohaji, Imo State. Iyamu stated, “The Niger Delta Petroleum Resources in Ogbele, Rivers State, has established an additional 10,000 bpd modular refinery. Civil works and installation of refinery are almost completed. “The company already has a pioneer 1,000 bpd mini refinery in the same site and it is expected to be inaugurated in the first week of November by the Presidency. “There’s also the Walter Smith modular refinery that is to be established with a capacity of 5,000 bpd in Imo State. The ground-breaking has been fixed for October 4.” He said the vision was part of the Federal Government’s 16-point agenda for the development of the region, which was already being carried out in phases.

 A former National Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party, Senator Ali Modu Sheriff, and his estranged political godson, Borno State Governor, Alhaji Kashim Shettima, have made up and called on members of the All Progressives Congress to work for the success of the party towards the 2019 general elections. Sheriff, who is Shettima’s predecessor, left the APC for the PDP during the last general elections, when the relationship with his successor broke down. Sheriff, who recently lost the chairmanship of the PDP to Ahmed Makarfi, was reported, during the week, to have defected to the APC. At a meeting of the stakeholders of the party in Borno State on Friday, the former governor called on all supporters of the party in the state to unite, shun selfish interests, and contribute towards the success of the party ahead of the 2019 general elections. Sheriff said, “I rejoined my great party, the APC, following the misunderstanding we had in PDP when I was the National Chairman. But I had to come back home and rejoin the APC, which is the party I helped to form. “I am joining the APC as an ordinary member, and I want to call on all and sundry to support the leadership of Governor Kashim Shettima and the APC in the state.” Also speaking at the meeting, which was also used to address the stakeholders ahead of the state congress slated to hold on Saturday (today), Shettima enjoined all the delegates to elect credible leaders so as to move the party forward. He said that as governor, he would not interfere with the congress as he was not supporting any candidate.

The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) yesterday denied freezing the accounts of the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP), Sen. Ademola Adeleke and any member of his family. The agency, in a statement by its Head of Media and Publicity, Mr. Wilson Uwujaren, warned against being drawn into partisan politics. The statement said: “The attention of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC has been drawn to media publications alleging that it had frozen the account of Senator Ademola Adeleke,  candidate of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the September 22, 2018 Osun State governorship election and those of his family members, including the musician, David Adeleke. “The commission calls on members of the public to disregard the report, which is patently false and contrived to dress the agency with a partisan garb in the unfolding political contest in Osun State. “For the avoidance of doubt, at no time did the EFCC place a freeze order on any  account belonging to members of the Adeleke family. “The purported freeze order, which has unfortunately been amplified by pliable sections of the media without any attempt at confirmation, is alien to the commission and another example of fake news. “The EFCC frowns at the seeming attempts by faceless forces to drag it into the political fray and, for the umpteenth time, restates its neutrality as a law enforcement organisation that is sworn to uphold the law at all times,  irrespective whose interest is at stake.”

House of Representatives Deputy Speaker Lasun Yussuff has declared his intention to vie for September 22 governorship election in Osun State. Yussuff, who made the declaration yesterday at the All Progressives Congress (APC) secretariat in Osogbo, the state capital, said he was the man for the job. He said there was no negative sign that he would not perform creditably well, if given the opportunity to govern the state. The deputy speaker, who said he had been one of the loyal party members, added that Osun State residents were waiting for him to govern the state. The deputy speaker said he would ensure that the OYES scheme was backed by legislation. Yussuff also said he would engage in manpower training in the Education sector, embark on agriculture revolution and improve on the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) in the state. He added: “I am not fighting to be governor. Rather, I want to be the governor because I have the experience and the exposure. “The people of the state want me and are waiting for me to rule them because I am the one the cap fits. I will not disappoint them.” Welcoming the aspirant to the party secretariat, the state APC Chairman Gboyega Famodun said there was no doubt that the aspirant had the political exposure and experience to rule the state. He said: “If it is the will of God for you to be the governor, so be it. But one thing that is sure is that it is only one person who will pick the party’s ticket for the election.” The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that 27 aspirants on the platform of APC have so far expressed their intention to contest the party’s primary ahead of the governorship election. The date of the party primary has not been fixed

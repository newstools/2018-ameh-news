The National Agency for Food and Drugs Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has said that sensitising herbal and traditional medicine practitioners on best practices would make the trade earn foreign exchange for the country. Mr Anikoh Ibrahim, NAFDAC Coordinator who disclosed this in Niger state said that clear-cut policies must be enacted for herbal and traditional medicine practitioners to adhere to international best practices in their trade. “Right now NAFDAC is collaborating with herbal and traditional medicine practitioners in Niger state to achieve the standardisation of herbal medicine products through workshops for the practitioners. “The workshops will provide government with ideas to come up with policies that will bring our herbal and traditional medicines practices to better acceptance in international commerce as an alternative foreign exchange earner for the nation,’’he said.

The country fell into recession in 2016 largely because of low crude oil prices. Lower oil revenues led to dollar shortages, since crude sales are the country’s main source of dollars. The economy emerged from recession in the second quarter of last year as crude prices recovered and militant attacks against Niger Delta oil production facilities ended. The reserves hit $42bn last week, the CBN said.

The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), President, Dr Frank Udemba Jacobs said, “we are also worried that the Director General of Nigeria Office Trade Negotiation (NOTN) “Chief Negotiator’ doubles as Chairman of AU-AfCFTA Negotiation Committee and may need to balance allegiance to both Nigeria and the AU-AfCFTA Negotiation Committee; as such, we implore the Federal Government to consider appointing a National Chief Negotiator that will be saddled with the responsibility of negotiating specifically for Nigeria.”  Dr Jacobs while response to if MAN is calling for vote of no confidence on the Director General of Nigeria Office Trade Negotiation as a person? He said no, Ambassador Chiedu Osakwe is good as a Chairman of AU-AFCTA Negotiation Committee but doubles responsibility in this matter will not spell clearly where his loyalty will be. Ambassador Chiedu Osakwe as Director General of Nigeria Office Trade Negotiation as a person is fantastic on the job but Nigeria needs a person to be responsible directly on the matter but Ambassador Chiedu Osakwe can support the Nigeria Negotiator during decision.  Dr Jacobs cited example saying “It is evident that Nigeria is not alone in the call for circumspection and consideration for due diligence before signing-on to the AfCFTA.  Experience from the Africa-Wide Multi-Stakeholder Consultation in Accra, Ghana As part of the outcomes of the Africa-Wide Multi-Stakeholder Consultation among representatives of National Governments, Regional Commissions, including African Union Commission, Organised Private Sector Groups, Civil Society Organisations and Women centered Gender Organisations, organized by the Third World Network Africa and held in Accra, Ghana in June 2018, it was agreed as follows:         Dr Jacobs reiterated that MAN respect Ambassador Chiedu Osakwe as person and chief negotiator because Ambassador is a skillful person in this matter of AFCFTA but Nigeria needs a separate person to focus on Nigeria matters specifically because Nigeria has the largest market on the continent which they are targeting at.  “Therefore Nigeria should lead the process of ensuring that the above recommendations are implemented adding that Nigeria’s action will further demonstrate leadership of the country in the continent by ensuring that those relating to the sub-region and the continent and equally elevated to the level of the African Union for necessary implementation.”  MAN President reiterated that AfCFTA is a good project that will benefit Nigeria if properly negotiated; as it would expand Market Access for export of Nigerian products and improve the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector.  However, he said, the starting point of an effective AfCTFA negotiation is the recommended studies, robust consultations and proper representation of manufacturing and the private sectors at all National and Continental AfCFTA negotiation meetings. This we believe would equip members of the Nigerian negotiating team with requisite data for the negotiations ahead, he added.

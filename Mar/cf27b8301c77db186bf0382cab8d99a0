 The founder of the Oodua People’s Congress, Dr. Fredrick Fasehun, has condemned the Federal Government for offering amnesty to terrorists. Fasehun said in a statement on Wednesday that the amnesty offer was evidence that the Federal Government’s claim that Boko Haram has been defeated was mere propaganda. “Offering amnesty to a world-acclaimed terrorist organisation is the most unequivocal testimonial that government has been merely spewing lies and propaganda about defeating Boko Haram,” he said. According to Fasehun, President Muhammadu Buhari’s recent offer of amnesty to Boko Haram was an insult to the dead, maimed and internally displaced victims of the anti-western education terrorists, as well as soldiers who lost their lives in the fight against terrorism. “If the government says it has defeated Boko Haram, technically or completely, then what is the rationale for offering pardon to these terrorists? Instead, the government should commit its energy to totally breaking Boko Haram and other insurgents, just like Iraq has done to ISIS.” Describing the amnesty offer as “irrational and inciting,” the OPC founder said, “Boko Haram does not deserve pardon because it is an unapologetic terrorist gang whose unprovoked and large-scale killing of innocent civilians places it in the league of Al-Qaeda, Taliban, ISIS and ISIL. “We demand that they be brought to justice.” He said rather than being tried in regular courts, Boko Haram members should face military court martial, while those found guilty should be sentenced to death.

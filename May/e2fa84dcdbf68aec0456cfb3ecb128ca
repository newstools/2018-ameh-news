The governor described the initiative as giant step toward efficiency in deployment of goods and services to create maximum impact on majority of the people through the deployment of technology. Mr Ahmed said the MOU would lead to an improvement in the quality of service delivery, shorten turnaround time and maintain consistency in services. The governor stated that the digitisation of land administration in the state would also increase the Internally Generated Revenue. Mr Ahmed added that it would improve public perception of state bureaucracy and strengthen institutional capacity as well as improve overall performance of the public service.

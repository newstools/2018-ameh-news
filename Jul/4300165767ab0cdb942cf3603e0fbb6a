 As part  of efforts to correct investors’ perception about Lagos, the State Government has unveiled investment opportunities that abound in the State to prospective investors, aimed at turning the state to the most desirable investment destination globally. At  theunveiling of the initiative, tagged ‘Lagos To The World (L2W), held last weekend, the State Government presented a deal book specifically with detailed opportunities in key sectors. Speaking at the event which was attended by members of the diplomatic missions and the business community, Special Adviser, Lagos State Office of Overseas Affairs and Investment, otherwise known as Lagos Global, Prof. Ademola Abass, lamented that the story of the strides achieved by the government were not properly told globally. He stated: “We felt the world need to be informed on how present administration has in the last three years worked towards improving all facets of the state especially in terms of infrastructural development, security, roads, energy and so on. “What we found out is that very little is known about Lagos State out there and we thought it is high time we began to more forcefully push Lagos narrative overseas. Today is about unpacking Lagos; it is about how to move Lagos forward; it is about marketing Lagos and communicating investment opportunities in Lagos to investors both in Nigeria and outside the country,” Abass added. The Commissioner for Commerce, Industry and Cooperatives, Mrs. Olayinka Oladunjoye, said that lots of incentives have been provided to encourage investment.

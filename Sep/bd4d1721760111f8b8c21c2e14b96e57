President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday urged Osun State residents to save the state from returning to the “dark days”. Leading top members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to a mega rally for the party’s candidate in Saturday’s governorship election, Gboyega Isiaka Oyetola, the President urged the residents to renew the party’s mandate in the state. He told the crowd that the APC leaders were in the state to celebrate the eventful eight years of Governor Rauf Aregbesola. He said: “We are here to thank Almighty God for the successful 8 years tenure of the APC Government in this state under the leadership of His Excellency, Rauf Aregbesola, the Omoluabi of Yorubaland. “We are also here to pray to Almighty God to safeguard and consolidate on this through Isiaka Gboyega Oyetola. “You are fully aware of this great partnership story. Oyetola is a partner, a trusted advisor, a brother and a friend to Governor Aregbesola. They have seamlessly worked together for many years serving you. “By electing Oyetola as your Governor, you are guaranteeing the consolidation of these successes. Eight years after Governor Aregbesola took the mantle of leading the business of government in Osun, the state now has excellent infrastructure for primary and secondary schools. The school that I commissioned in 2016 is one of the best schools in Nigeria. But more work remains to be done. Oyetola is ready for work. “Osun State has empowerment programmes to support entrepreneurs. You had school construction and rehabilitation programmess to improve the quality of education. You had hygiene, sanitation and health care programs to improve the quality of life. You had security and outreach programs that enhanced peace and stability in your communities.”

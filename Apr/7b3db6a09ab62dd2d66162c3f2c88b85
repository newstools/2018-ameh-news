 Governor Ayodele Fayose of Ekiti State has hit back at perceived critics who he said were waiting for the expiration of his tenure to deal with him. Fayose said that ‘they would do so in vain’, when he was hosted at a political programme, Sunday Politics, on Channels Television on Sunday. “Those waiting for me (after leaving office) would wait in vain. “I am Peter, the rock. I am telling you again, those waiting for me will wait in vain,” he said Fayose whose second term as Ekiti governor would come to an end this year (2018) maintained that he feared nobody and owed no one apology for defending the people on the path of truth. “I have done everything, I have defended Nigerians in good conscience and I have no apologies and I will never have one. If they like let them lock me up from today until next year. Let me tell you, we have seen Presidents, we will still see more,” Fayose added. On the issue of the $1 billion withdrawal from the Excess Crude Oil account, the governor accused the Federal Government of mismanaging funds from the Federal account which he feels are meant for the three tiers of government. “Every accrual in this country is supposed to go into a Federal account that is supposed to be shared by the three tiers of government. As at today, the Federal Government is spending money that belongs to the three tiers of government. “The Supreme court nullified the excess crude account which means all accruals must go into a central purse. Where the Federal Government will take their share, the state will take their share and the local government will take their share,” he said. Fayose also renewed his commitment to joining the presidential race, vowing not to rescind on the matter even in the face of expected persecution.

The President, Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria, Dr Uche Olowu, has advised the government on the need to use a new industrial revolution as a catalyst for economic development. He also said that an overhaul of the current educational system must be embarked upon in an era of knowledge-based economy, intellectual property, knowledge and information systems that could drive an ever-increasing pace of scientific and technological breakthroughs to support production and services. He said, “Nigeria missed out on the first three industrial revolutions and cannot afford to miss out on the fourth which leverages technology to boost productivity, create sustainable economic development and a better standard of living. Generally speaking, our aspirations cannot be achieved without a strong and competent workforce.” While some would argue that the Nigerian government had made some efforts towards strengthening the human capacity of its citizens, he said that the efforts appeared to be a little drop in an ocean. “Suffice to say that a state of emergency should be declared in our educational sector,” Olowu said. According to him, the financial services sector also has its own dose of lack of skills and has militated against broadening and deepening the financial markets. He said that more professional bankers with the requisite and diverse skills set were needed. While reaffirming the CIBN’s commitment to bridging the skills and upholding ethical conduct and professionalism in the industry, he said it remained committed to its advocacy role as the conscience of the industry.

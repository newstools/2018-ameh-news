 The Minister of Finance, Mrs. Kemi Adeosun, will on Thursday speak on the issue of taxation and revenue leakages at a tax conference organised by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development at the United Nations in New York, United States. The Platform for Collaboration on Tax Conference, which will hold between Wednesday and Friday, is a collaborative initiative of the United Nations, OECD, International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group. The Director of Centre for Tax Policy and Administration, OECD, Pascal Saint-Amans, who signed the invitation letter, said the minister would also be in a panel to discuss ‘Revenue leakages: Illicit financial flows’. Saint-Amans, according to a statement by the minister’s Media Adviser, Oluyinka Akintunde, noted that tackling illicit financial flows was a priority for most countries. He said the panellists would address the impact of the illicit financial flows, particularly those caused by tax evasion and corruption on sustainable development. He stated, “The panel of discussants will discuss measures, both at the national and international level, which may help to reduce IFFs and identify opportunities to increase cooperation among a range of actors tackling IFFs. “The measures should also cover policies and actions that may address the underlying behaviours that give raise to IFFs, as well as the challenges limiting progress and taking into consideration fragile settings. “We would therefore be honoured to have your presence on our programme, given the strong support Nigeria has shown for international cooperation on tax.”

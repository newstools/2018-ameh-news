 A business mogul, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, has donated an ultra-modern business school to the Bayero University, Kano. Named Dangote Business School, the businessman said the facility was worth N1.2bn, adding that plans had commenced to affiliate it with the Havard Business School in the United States of America. According to a statement on Sunday, Dangote, while speaking at the opening of the school, noted that effort was made to ensure that the school met the international standards and be one of the biggest in the sub Sahara Africa. He said the Business School, which was opened by the Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, was conceived as part of his contributions towards encouraging world-class entrepreneurship education in Nigeria. “He described the school as best of its kind in northern Nigeria, adding that the school, as accredited by the National Universities Commission, will be the first business school to offer Doctor of Business Administration programme in Nigeria. “The African richest man added that the business school would ease sharing of business information globally and how future African leaders could advance their businesses as well as building capacity which would translate to boosting the continent’s economy,” the statement read in part. The statement also quoted the Vice-Chancellor of the university, Prof. Muhammed Bello, as saying that the new business school would make the university to serve the society better through training, research and services. He said the university adopted the name “Dangote Business School” because Dangote was internationally synonymous with innovation, entrepreneurship and successes in business and industry. “The new structure comprises 650 seating capacity auditorium, two theatres, four lecture halls, two libraries, incubation centre, two cafeterias, 800kva soundproof generator and borehole among others,” Bello added.

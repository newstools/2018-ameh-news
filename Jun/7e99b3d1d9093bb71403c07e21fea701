As part of its contribution to a safe environment, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has resolved to recycle polymer bank note wastes into plastics such as flower pots and dustbins. Speaking at this year’s World Environment Day in Abuja, the CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele said the management of the CBN is “in the process of concluding the recycling of our polymer bank note wastes into everyday plastics uses such as flower pots, dustbins, etc.” In addition, he pledged that the top management of the CBN including the deputy governors can be counted on to act as change champions. As a result, he said the committee of governors will be making very serious considerations and alternatives to plastic. One of such alternatives he said would be encouraging the use of paper bags as alternatives to plastic bags. “First of all, management havepout the recycling of our paper waste into tissue paper which will be donated to the society as part of our corporate social responsibility,” he said. Speaking on the dangers of plastics particularly single-use plastics, Emefiele said scientists have calculated the total amount of plastic ever made to be 8.3 million tons. He lamented that mankind has “become over-dependent on single use or disposable plastic with its attendant and severe environmental consequences.” According to the United Nations (UN), more than 300 million tons of plastic is produced each year and half of it is single use or disposable.  Single use or disposable plastics are used only once before they are thrown away or recycled. These include items such as plastic bag, coffee stirrers, soda and water bottles, disposable utensils and most food packaging. Emefiele said: “It is horrifying to learn that across the world, plastic make up about 85 per cent of marine litter; with micro-plastics in the air, water and food  – having an unknown impact on human health.”

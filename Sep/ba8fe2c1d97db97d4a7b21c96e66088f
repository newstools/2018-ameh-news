THE Nigerian Agricultural Insurance Corporation (NAIC) has called on insured farmers and farmer groups affected by floods to inform its NAIC office of their travails for assistance. Its Managing Director, Mrs. Folashade Joseph made the call during a briefing tagged, “On-going flood damages to agricultural farms in various states of the country”. While sympathising with the affected farmers, she assured insured farmers and groups of its support. She urged the farmers to  minimise the untoward effects of the torrential rains and floods on their farms through taking an insurance cover. She sympathised with other farmers who suffered from losses from the floods but did not have NAIC cover and encouraged them to, take advantage of the agricultural insurance solutions of the corporation, in accordance with the government’s policies to protect farmers. Mrs. Joseph said apart from insuring the loss of crops from flood, NAIC provides insurance against crop losses arising from fire, lightening, drought and pests. Also listed are associated  risks of death of, or injury to livestock caused by accident, disease, fire, lightening, storm or flood. She said the beauty is that the assessed premium paid to NAIC is subsidised. The subsidy is 50 per cent reimbursable to the corporation by the federal and state governments. ‘’All these are efforts to provide a secure future to farmers and eliminate the need for unpredictable ad-hoc assistance when insurable losses occur,” she added.

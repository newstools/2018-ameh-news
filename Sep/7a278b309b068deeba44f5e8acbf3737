The regime of lack of regulator in the country’s transportation sector is getting to an end, if anything as the Minister of Transportation, Mr Rotimi Amaechi, says the Federal Government is set to convert Nigeria Shippers Council (NSC) to National Transport Commission (NTC). Amaechi said this at a news conference on the achievement of the ministry on Wednesday in Abuja. He said that the National Assembly had passed a bill that Shippers’ Council should be transformed to a commission, adding that the bill was currently awaiting presidential assent to become a law. “Senate has passed the bill that converts Nigeria Shippers’ Council to National Transport Commission (NTC), the bill is currently waiting for the assent of the President. “When NTC is signed into law it will be capable of setting the transport sector on the path of positive development,’’ he said. Amaechi said it would also create a multi-modal transport sector economic and safety oversight commission that would drive the national transport policy. Is the minister sure NSC having adequate capacity to handles national through NTC? A sector regulator turned national within two years, hah.

A former Oyo State governor, Adebayo Alao-Akala, has denied plans to dump the All Progressives Congress in order to achieve his ambition of contesting in the state governorship election in 2019. The former governor, on Monday, left Ibadan for Abuja to submit his governorship nomination forms which confirmed his decision to contest the 2019 governorship election on the platform of the APC in the state. After two meetings between the governor, Abiola Ajimobi, and 26 governorship aspirants of the party on Saturday and Sunday, an unconfirmed report said Alao-Akala and a few other aspirants were uncomfortable with the governor’s body language and that they were considering defecting to other parties. Alao-Akala was said to have made contact with the leadership of the Africa Democratic Congress in a bid to be the party’s standard bearer for the 2019 governorship election in the state. But a statement signed by the Head, New Media and Public Affairs, Alao-Akala Campaign Organisation, Jeremiah Akande, denied the move, stressing that the former governor was not considering dropping his ambition or dumping the APC. The statement read in part, “The Media and Publicity Directorate of Alao-Akala Campaign Organisation, after a careful study of the said report and unfounded information pieced together in the body of the story, came to a professional conclusion that the idea behind the report was a mere publicity stunt aimed at laundering the image of the political party in question. “The campaign organisation of Alao-Akala wishes to once again reiterate His Excellency, Alao-Akala’s unshaken commitment and dedication to the ideals of the APC in Oyo State and at the national level and urge his teeming supporters to remain steadfast and resolute in their belief in him, as the journey towards 2019 begins in earnest.”

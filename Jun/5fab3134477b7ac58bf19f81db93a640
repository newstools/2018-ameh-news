The Manufacturers Association of Nigerian (MAN) in her executive summary of second half reports of 2017 released showed that the local sourcing of raw-materials averaged 63.2 percent in 2017 as against 53.1 percent in 2016; thereby indicating 10.1 percentage point increase over the period.  The MAN pointed out that local sourcing of raw-materials continued to trend up among manufacturers in the second half of 2017. The movement was linked to the implementation of resource-based industrialization and backward integration policy as contained in Nigeria’s Industrial Revolution Plan (NIRP).

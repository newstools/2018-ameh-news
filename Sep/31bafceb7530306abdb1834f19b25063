A federal lawmaker, Senate Ali Ndume, has expressed concern over the escalation of Boko Haram attacks on Nigerian troops and residents in the North-East. Ndume, who represents Borno South Senatorial District, voiced his thoughts while speaking with journalists on Friday, the News Agency of Nigeria reported. He stated that Boko Haram had launched several attacks, which led to deaths of soldiers in Borno and Yobe states. He said, “I am worried on the sudden resurgence of Boko Haram in the North East. “Some weeks ago, it was alleged that 48 soldiers were killed. On Tuesday, there was another attack in Wala Pulka in Gwoza where it was alleged that many passengers were abducted. “There was an attack some time ago in Jilli where many soldiers were killed, another came in Zari. There was another one in Njimtilo and Bama axis. I learnt also that there was an attack on commuters along Maiduguri to Ngala. All these attacks occurred in two months.” He added, “So, I am really worried and sure the security agencies are also disturbed. I appreciate that changes were made as a result of the last attacks, but that is not enough. There are black spots which security agencies must address. These are known and the military must identify and make the area clean instead of waiting on trenches and wait for what will happen. “I think there should be some changes so that Boko Haram don’t even think of coming to attack any troop. The military formations must always be on alert. I am not a military man, but whenever somebody always comes to your house without any fear, that means you are relapsed or sleeping.” Ndume promised to visit the military chiefs and discuss further on areas of challenge to nib the scourge in the bud.

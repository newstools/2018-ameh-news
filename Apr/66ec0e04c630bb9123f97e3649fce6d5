 The Board of the National Emergency Management Agency on Thursday announced the indefinite suspension of six directors of the organisation. The suspension of the affected officials by the newly inaugurated board was in connection with the ongoing probe of the finances of NEMA by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. The financial years being reviewed by the anti-graft agency are from 2011 to 2015. Those placed on suspension, according to a statement issued by the Head Media and Public Relations, NEMA, Sani Datti, include the Director of Finance and Accounts, Akinbola Gbolahan; Ag. Director, Special Duties, Mr. Umesi Emenike;  and Director, Risk Reduction, Mallam Alhassan Nuhu. Others are pilot in charge of Air Ambulance and Aviation Unit, Mr. Mamman Ali Ibrahim; the Chief Maintenance Officer, Mr. Ganiyu Yunusa Deji; and the Director of Welfare, Mr. Kanar Mohammed. The EFCC had in a report to the Presidency recommended the disciplinary measure in order to enable it to conduct unhindered investigations and access to vital records. Based on the EFCC’s recommendation, the board of NEMA approved the suspension and directed the management to give effect to its decision. The board also mandated the management of NEMA to cooperate with the EFCC in the ongoing probe. The EFCC  had in January  launched a fresh investigation into a former Director General of NEMA and other serving directors of the agency.

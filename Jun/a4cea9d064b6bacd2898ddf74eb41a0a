The Standard Organisations of Nigeria (SON) in Anambra State has impounded 1,223 cartons of “EmmaScale” paint for non-compliance to quality standards. It also sealed the warehouse of EmmaScale Nigeria Ltd. on Modebe Street and its Operational Office in the Building Materials Market, Bridge Head, Onitsha. A SON official, Viginus Omeje, said the seized product was neither registered nor presented for quality assessment. According to Omeje, the company also faked SON’s registration logo which was assigned to a similar product, thus misleading the public.

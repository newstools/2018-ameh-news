 The National Council of Women’s Societies (NCWS) has demanded for the implementation of 35 per cent affirmative action in favour of females in all development national issues. The President of NCWS, Dr Gloria Laraba Shoda made the demand in a statement on Sunday in Abuja. “While we appreciate President Muhammadu Buhari for his efforts at repositioning the country and look forward to a free, fair and inclusive political process in Nigeria come 2019, we urge him to remember the women and give us our 35 per cent. “Women have the right to participate in political processes that affect us, our families and our societies. “Countries with increased women’s participation and leadership in civil society and political parties tend to be more inclusive, responsive, egalitarian and democratic. “When women meaningfully participate in peace processes, they can help to expand the scope of agreements and improve the prospects for durable peace,’’Shoda said. She said that strengthening women’s rights and addressing barriers to political participation are critical to achieving gender equality and female empowerment.
However, Dr Shoda commended Buhari for signing the ‘Not Too Young To Run’ bill into law. President Buhari accented to the bill last week, in fulfillment of a promise made in his Democracy Day address. Shoda noted that signing the bill into law was a call to nation building and practical ways the president demonstrated that Nigerian youths could no longer remain spectators. “The action is a welcome development and a new dawn for our youths to take a centre stage of political activities in the country.’’ “I congratulate Nigerian youths over the signing into law of the ‘Not Too Young To Run’ bill by President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday,’’ she said.

The Nigerian Communications Commission has suspended the allocation of frequency spectrums that are likely to be approved by the International Telecommunications Union for 5G network services. Executive Vice- Chairman at NCC, Prof Umar Danbatta, disclosed this at a Stakeholders Consultative Forum in Abuja on Tuesday. Danbatta was represented at the event by Director of Spectrum Administration, Mr Austin Nwaulune, He said it was important to suspend the allocation of the frequency to operators so that there would not be any encumbrance when the frequencies were eventually assigned for  5G services by ITU. He listed the frequencies affected as 26GHz, 38Ghz and 42Ghz bands. Danbatta said, “The commission has identified some of the potential frequency bands that may be harmonised for 5G deployment in region one and therefore suspended the licensing of those frequencies. “This step will ensure that Nigeria is not caught unawares when those frequency bands are harmonised by standardisation bodies.  Key among these bands are 26Ghz, 38Ghz and 42Ghz bands. “According to a research conducted by GSMA in 2018, about 5.17 billion people were already mobile in 2017 and it is projected to rise to six billion by 2025. In Nigeria alone, going by September statistics, we had about 106 million active internet subscribers.” He added, “In another research by McKinsey Global, it is estimated that over 75 billion devices will be connected to the Internet by the year 2025, with global economic contribution ranging from $3.9 to $11.1tn annually. “As such, all stakeholders are challenged to help develop smarter and efficient ways of utilising the already limited available resources in order to maximise the gains of these technologies.” Danbatta said 5G technology was unique, promising and customisable.

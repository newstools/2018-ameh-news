 The federal cabinet has approved the sum of seventy-nine point nine billion naira for the reconstruction of the road from Apapa to the toll gate on Lagos-Ibadan expressway in Lagos state, South-West Nigeria. Minister of Works, Power and Housing Babatunde Fashola disclosed this to State house Correspondents on Wednesday while briefing them on decisions reached at this week’s cabinet meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari. Long-Term Solution Fashola said the decision was taken to provide a long term solution to the road, which has suffered a lot of grid lock in recent times. “The Ministry of Power, Works and Housing secured approval for the reconstruction of the Creek Road-Tincan Island-Beach Land right through to Oworoshoki to the toll gate end of the Lagos-Ibadan expressway for the full reconstruction of that road which was built around 1975 as part of our first port expansion undertaken then in the 70s. That road was intended to evacuate cargo out of Lagos without running through the spine of the city. The road is now in some state of disrepair and Council has approved its reconstruction at the cost of N72.9 billion,” he said. He said the work will be done using a Public-Private Partnership PPP model and the constructing firm will be Dangote Group, which will finance the project to the tune of N72.9 billion, which will be recovered through the funding credit tax policy of government. The Minister further said when fully constructed, the road will have 10 lanes, with five on both sides, with a total of 270.8 linear kilometres, including drainage, rehabilitation of some of the bridges and interchanges.

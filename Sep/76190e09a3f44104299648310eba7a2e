THE Food and Beverage Recycling Alliance (FBRA), the ProducerResponsibility Organisation (PRO) for the food and beverage sector, will on Saturday hold a clean up as part of its activities to mark the World Clean-up Day. The body, along with its partner, Recycle Points, will tomorrow embark on a clean-up of the Arena market in Oshodi, Lagos. During the exercise, which is also aimed at intensifying awareness on environmental pollution, Alliance volunters would  engage in the cleaning of refuse sites, walkways and drainages in the market. The body, in a statement, said  this would be another demonstration of its commitment to a cleaner environment after the recently-signed memorandum of understanding with Ministry of Transport and Environment, Lagos State to rid the waterways of plastic waste. The not-for-profit organisation claimed it had been adhering to the Federal Government’s policy on Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), which transfers the life-cycle of products to manufacturers, especially at the post-consumer stages. During the clean-up, stakeholders would discuss crucial proper disposal and recycling, healthy lifestyle and other measures aimed at curbing environmental pollution. FBRA is calling for sectoral action under the platform of a PRO to ensure that companies engage in the recycling to demonstrate its concern for a cleaner and healthier society. It said through the PRO, companies could pool resources together to develop and fund a robust buyback scheme that could attract investors in recycling infrastructure. FBRA said the strategy would attract investment in research and development of new packaging process.

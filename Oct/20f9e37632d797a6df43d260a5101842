The Bayelsa State Government is targeting 16,000 direct jobs and thousands of indirect jobs through the establishment of aquaculture villages across the local government areas in the state. As part of the measures to achieve this, the state government on Tuesday handed over the management of a multi-million naira aquaculture village built by Governor Seriake Dickson to a private firm, Aquaseas Company Limited. The aquaculture village located in Yenegwe, Yenagoa Local Government Area of the state, sits on 127 hectares land with over 500 fish ponds. The concession agreement involving the government, Aquaseas and the Unity Bank Plc was signed at the stateâ€™s Ministry of Agriculture, Yenagoa, and was witnessed by top government officials and the trained beneficiaries.

The Chairman, Amugold Group of Industries, Mr. Amujo Temitope, has said that the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control has stringent conditions for manufactures. Speaking during the group’s ‘Jimbo Orie Kiddies’ contest in Ilorin, Kwara State, he said the conditions were not easy for indigenous small-scale manufacturers to comply with. Temitope said while the products of the indigenous manufacturers could compete favourably internationally, NAFDAC conditions had inhibited such makers from exposing their products to the international market and thereby prevented them from earning foreign exchange. He appealed to NAFDAC to make their conditions less stringent and cumbersome so as to enhance industrialisation and exports. He said, “Conditions imposed by NAFDAC to certify products from indigenous manufacturers are very stringent. Many manufacturers find it very difficult to meet up with and such has been inhibiting manufacturing and job creation.” The manufacturer also identified power epilepsy, high cost of energy, poor infrastructure and multiple taxes as impediments to industrialisation and manufacturing in Nigeria. According to him, there are many gifted people in the country, adding that government should provide environment conducive for businesses to thrive.

Members of the National Association of Royale Food Stuff Millers and Grinders of Nigeria have called on Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo to extend the Federal Government’s TraderMoni loan facility to them, promising to make the refund within a short period. The collateral-free loan, which is being disbursed through the Bank of Industry to traders across Nigeria, is part of the Federal Government’s National Social Investment Programme under the Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme meant to reinforce its commitment to bridge the credit gap and empower Nigerians at the grassroots. Osinbajo was in Ibadan recently to assess the disbursement of the loan to 27,000 beneficiaries, each of whom got N10,000. During the official presentation of the certificate of incorporation to the association in Ibadan by the Corporate Affairs Commission, the National President, NARFSMGN, Ogundare Akanbi, said members would appreciate the Federal Government’s gesture as it would help them grow their business, alleviate poverty among them and contribute to the economy of the nation. He stated, “We need the Federal Government to assist us in purchase of grinding machines in large numbers and subsidised rate for us to reimburse on instalments from state to state.”

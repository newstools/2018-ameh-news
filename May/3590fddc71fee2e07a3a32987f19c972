  The International Energy Agency, IEA, and the African Union, AU, have entered into a strategic partnership towards a more secure, sustainable and clean energy future for countries across the African continent. The joint commitment was cemented through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed last Friday in Paris by Dr Fatih Birol, the IEA’s Executive Director, and H.E. Dr Amani Abou-Zeid, the African Union Commissioner for Infrastructure, Energy, ICT and Tourism. The MoU provides a general framework for cooperation on activities and projects that advance shared interests in areas of energy security, energy statistics, energy efficiency, renewable energy, and sustainable economic development. It reflects the IEA’s strong commitment to global engagement on energy access and sustainable development, and to working closely with emerging economies to find solutions to energy and environmental challenges. “There is a saying in Africa – if you want to go fast, you go alone; if you want to go far, you go together,” said Dr Abou-Zeid. Dr Abou-Zeid added: “It is the reason we decided to enter into a strategic partnership with the IEA. The signing of this MoU marks a milestone for the AUC and IEA. It will strengthen our ability to deliver on our respective mandates in a mutually enriching way.” Dr Birol also commented: “The agreement is a cornerstone of joint efforts to work toward a more secure, sustainable and clean energy future for Africa. “The timing of our ceremony here today could not be more appropriate as across the world we celebrate this 55th anniversary of Africa Day.” Eradicating energy poverty is a priority for the IEA and the agreement will play a vital role in stepping up efforts to achieve secure and sustainable energy for all.

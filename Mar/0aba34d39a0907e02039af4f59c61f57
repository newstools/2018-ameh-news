The award, in recognition of the company’s huge financial investments in the nation’s downstream sector of the hydrocarbon industry, was presented during the Nigeria International Petroleum Summit in Abuja. Presenting the award to the company at the event, the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources, Dr. Folasade Yemi-Ojo, said it was part of the Federal Government’s efforts to encourage operators who had shown considerable interest in the growth of the industry.

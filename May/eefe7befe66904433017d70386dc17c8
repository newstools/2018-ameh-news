 Osun State Governor Rauf Aregbesola has installed an electronic beam indicating a daily countdown to the November 17 expiration of his tenure. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the beam, installed at the reception hall in the Governor’s Office in Osogbo, indicates on a daily basis, the number of days left for the governor to spend in office. NAN reports that when the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, visited the governor on Monday, the countdown indicated 191 days. The beam reads: “191 days Home Run Countdown”, meaning the governor and his executive council (exco) have 191 days to the end of their tenure and to vacate office. Speaking to NAN on the countdown beam, Mr Ismail Ademola, the special adviser to the governor on Wealth Creation, said it was meant to bring to the consciousness of every member of the executive that the administration was winding down. He said it was also meant to spur them to intensify speedy delivery of democracy dividends to the people.

The Department of State Security (DSS) has arrested five persons in Anambra State for the alleged diversion of government funds. The suspects allegedly issued fake receipts at Ogbaru market. They were arrested when the Commissioner for Trade, Commerce, Market and Wealth Creation, Christian Madubuko, visited the market on an inspection tour. Madubuko explained how the culprits, including market leaders, siphoned government fund into their personal pockets by issuing counterfeit receipts to traders. The commissioner, who was accompanied by a DSS team, called for honesty from those in charge of government resources in tandem with government policies. President-General of Ogbaru Main Market Victor Nwawuzie, who listed storage fee, development levy, legal tax and sanitation levy as part of fees the government authorised him to collect, denied the allegations.

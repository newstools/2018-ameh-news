In what look like taking to the position of Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) on AFCFTA before sign the Agreement, in a stakeholders meeting in Abuja, the Director General of the Nigeria Export Promotion Council (NEPC), Olusegun Awolowo, says Nigeria has the potential to dominate the African trade market through the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). Awolowo speaking on the sideline of upcoming an engagement event to promote Intra-African Trade Fair to be held in Egypt, saying Nigeria will not only sign the AfCFTA, but will also drive its implementation in Africa. The NEPC boss disclosed that language barrier, inadequate transportation networks and weak political will have been some of the major hindrances to intra-African trade, which Afreximbank and NEPC are collaborating to find solutions to. He cited report from the 2017 statistics of the International Trade Centre that showed Nigeria only accounted for about 1 per cent in value of African imports from the world in 2017 of which 80 per cent was petroleum. Also speaking at event, the President of the African Export-Import bank (Afreximbank), Dr. Benedict Oramah, revealed that the fair was organised to promote trade within Africa. Dr Oramah said Africa can make up the value and volume of intra-African trade through the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which has the potential to boost trade by 53.2 per cent by eliminating import duties and non-tariff barriers. While, the Managing Director of Afreximbank’s Intra-African Trade Initiative, Kanayo Awani, added his opinion to that of Awolowo’ stands, saying “part of the reason for low trading among African countries is lack of knowledge of available export routes on the continent, standards and tariffs.”

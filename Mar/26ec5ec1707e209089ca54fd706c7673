 Colleges in the United States are actively seeking students from Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa and Ghana worthy of scholarships to further their education in America. According to the Head of Public Affairs, US Consulate in Lagos, Darcy Zotter, these are new opportunities that should be taken advantage of. Speaking at the ‘When Women Win’ Conference in Lagos on Friday, Zotter stated that 65 students in science, technology, and engineering disciplines would form 65 per cent of the beneficiaries, while 41 per cent would be for the humanities. Zotter said African students were deemed fit to be awarded the scholarships because they possessed language skills and had traditionally done well for themselves in terms of education. She advised interested candidates to visit the Education USA centre or the website to get important information. She added that there were also new opportunities for those seeking international working careers. Zotter stated, “Most people believe it is not possible to get a job in the US. The truth is, it is a lie. People are just scared to face the challenges and they try to discourage others too. “My advice to such people is that they should go and research well. Look at the qualifications and make sure you fit in, but be prepared for the challenges.”

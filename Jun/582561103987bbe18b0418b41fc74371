The Federal Government plans to inject N500 billion ($1.4 billion) into its low-cost mortgage lender over the next five years in an effort to spur home ownership. Faced with a housing deficit of 17 million units, Nigeria is seeking to improve access to home loans in an economy that vies with South Africa as the continent’s biggest. A lack of proper land deeds, poverty and record high interest rates means there are only an estimated 50,000 registered mortgages, of which state-owned Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN) accounts for 18,200, according to Chief Executive Officer Ahmed Musa Dangiwa. The lender is seeking to boost its capital from N5 billion at a rate of N100 billion  a year, he said in an interview on June 21 in the capital, Abuja. FMBN is expecting proposals on its recapitalisation, as well as a reorganisation of its business, to be approved by all arms of government by the end of 2018, Dangiwa said. The company’s current capital base is “grossly inadequate,” he said. “That’s why we’re in the process of ensuring that the capital base be increased.”

  The military on Friday said that a factional leader of the Boko Haram terrorist group, Mamman Nur, was fatally injured in an ongoing bombardment around the Lake Chad. Nur, who controls a faction of the insurgent group, is considered to be next in notoriety to the group’s feared leader, Abubakar Shekau. He is believed to control the Lake Chad axis of the sect, which in recent time has emerged a deadly haven of the terrorist group after the capture of the Sambisa Forest in December, 2016. A statement by the military through its Deputy Director Public Relations of Operation Lafiya Dole, Col. Onyema Nwachukwu, said, “Ongoing artillery and aerial bombardments of Boko Haram enclaves in the Lake Chad region by troops of Operation Lafiya Dole has continued to yield positive results. “Currently, an evaluation report of the ongoing operation indicates that a major factional leader of the terrorist group, Mamman Nur, has been fatally injured in the bombardment as he and his sub-commanders fled from the onslaught. “Several of his foot soldiers have also been killed by troops, while many of the insurgents who escaped are now surrendering to the Republic of Niger Defence Forces, following the amnesty granted the insurgents by the government of Niger Republic.”

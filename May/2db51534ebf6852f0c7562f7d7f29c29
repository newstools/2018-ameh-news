 Medview Airline has said it is not aware of any law suit by passengers over cancellation of a flight on August 13, 2017. This is coming on heel of reports in the press that some passengers have gone to court over the said flight. In a statement, the airline said it is yet to be served any court papers from any quarters, adding:”we have not received any pre-litigation letters as the practice, much less of properly served court papers”. “Sensationalization of impeding litigation in the press without recourse to us is tantamount to trial in the media, which is a grandiose to whip up public sentiments”, the statement said. As a responsible organization, the airline welcomes genuine complaints from passengers, and such complaints regarding flight cancellation, delays, missing baggage and refunds are handled in line with civil aviation laid  down procedures as contained in Part 19 of Civil Aviation Act 2013. Medview Airline is committed to its corporate value, which is the ability to succeed in providing the desired service for customers’ satisfaction and respect for individual clients, the statement further said.

The Kogi State Internal Revenue Service on Tuesday sealed off the facilities of MTN, Airtel, Forte oil and the Bank of Agriculture for refusing to pay taxes worth over N470m to the state government. The Director, Legal Services and Enforcement, Kogi IRS, Jamil Isah, who led his team to seal the critical  facilities of the two telecom service providers at Mount Patti, Obajana and other places in Lokoja, alleged that Airtel owed over N321m, while MTN allegedly refused to meet its obligation of over N140m to the Kogi State Government. Isah added that Forte Oil and the BoA owed N5m and N3m, respectively, saying their operation offices had been sealed off. He stated, “For quite some time, we have diligently approached the two telecom service providers to pay some of their tax liabilities to the state government and they refused to cooperate with us. “We then proceeded to the state High Court of Justice; the court, having looked into the case, granted us an order authorising us to seal their facilities until those obligations are discharged by the affected organisations and that was what we have done to ensure that they pay the outstanding taxes.” He lamented that Airtel had refused to pay its annual rent for the laying of fibre optic cable on Kogi soil, pointing out that the service provider was servicing its obligations in other states, and vowed that the IRS would continue to take decisive action in order to compel debtor organisations to pay their taxes. Isah added, “Pursuant to the directive of the Kogi State Governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello, for us to have a listening ears to the complaints and challenges of the taxpayers in the state; we meet with them from time to time and make amends where we can. “Sometimes, we stagger their tax payments; we do some waiver and we reduced the taxpayers’ liabilities in response to the challenges they present before us. All of these are to enable them pay their taxes as at when due.”

 The Federal Government has begun textiles, groundnuts and other products commercialisation. The first step is the establishment of the Kano Zonal Office for the implementation of the Nigeria Agribusiness and Agro-Industry Development Initiative (NAADI). Speaking at the flag-off of the office, Minister of State, Trade and Investment Mrs Aisha Abubakar said the initiative would focus on textiles and garments, hide and skin, livestock, fisheries, rice, sesame, groundnuts, tomato and pepper. Represented by the Permanent Secretary, Edet Akpan, the minister expressed optimism that the process would bring about poverty reduction, human capital develop-ment and prosperity to many. She said NAADI would facilitate the achievement of productive and profitable value chains as well as greater agribusiness participation in domestic and international markets. Mrs Abubakar decried the dependence on importation of manufactured products, which run into several billions of dollars yearly. She said the trend hadaffected “the required value-chain linkage between agriculture and industry which has not allowed us to move our agricultural products to industrial level for the final production of finished goods, products and equipment”. Mrs Abubakar said NAADI coordinating offices had been established in Akure, Bauchi, Uyo, Owerri, and Sokoto.

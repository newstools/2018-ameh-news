The Ilorin Emirate Youth Development Association (IEYDA) yesterday urged the police to be diligent in their investigation of the bloody April 5 robbery in Offa, Kwara State. The association made the plea in Ilorin, the state capital, in a statement jointly signed by its National President, Alhaji Babatunde Salaudeen and National Publicity Secretary, Alhaji Uthman Jagunma. It also expressed worry that Senate President Bukola Saraki was linked with the incident. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that Mr Jimoh Moshood, the force headquarters spokesman, had asserted at a briefing that some suspects arrested in connection with the robbery had indicted Saraki. It said: â€œThe association strongly stands against robbery and political thuggery and as such condemns same in their totality, particularly the Offa robbery, which led to the death of innocent citizens.

 The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) says it has generated N556.7 billion revenue from January to June as against N486.7 billion in the same period in 2017.
The Public Relations Officer (PRO) of NCS, Mr Joseph Attah announced this in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja. He said the Service also made 1,927 seizures from January to June as against 3,798 seizures in same period in 2017. “This shows increasing level of compliance, giving rise to more revenue and less seizures.
“There are some strategic actions taken that were responsible for the positive difference of N70 billion. “This includes blockage of identified revenue leakages by the Tariff and Trade Department and Introduction of Nigeria Integrated Customs Information System II (NICIS-II). “It also includes trade analysis and timely audit of the system to enhance revenue collection, among others. “The Service has continued to sharpen its anti-smuggling strategies, resulting in spectacular seizures of arms and ammunitions, illicit drugs, rice, and vehicles, among others,’’ he said. The PRO said the sustained onslaughts against smugglers had made them desperate and more inclined to mobilisng people to attack Customs operatives. Attah said the ugly development clearly shows how little smugglers value national economy and security. According to him, the Comptroller-General of Customs, retired Col. Hameed Ali, has warned that henceforth, NCS will not treat with levity any further attack on its operatives who are discharging their statutory functions. He said in such situation, officers would not hesitate to use appropriate force to defend themselves and protect national interest.

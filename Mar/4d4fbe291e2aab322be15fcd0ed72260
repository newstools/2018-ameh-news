Reacting to complaints from community members over alleged slow pace of work on the Michael Imodu-Ganmo-Afon Junction road and the attendant traffic snarl, Awosanya saidÂ  the ministry had impressed it on the contractor to ensure that the road was wet to reduce dust. He urged the residents and other road users to bear the inconveniences, adding that the FG was committed to ensuring timely completion of the project. He stated that the relocation of electric poles was hindering the speedy completion of the project, adding that the ministry had had talks with the Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company Plc on how to address the challenge.

The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole, has ruled out the likelihood of offering  the APC’s legislators automatic tickets  as a way of making them to remain in the party. Oshiomhole said this at a meeting with the APC caucus in the House of Representatives at the party’s national secretariat in Abuja on Thursday. He explained that the best the party could offer in line with its democratic practice was to provide a level playing field for all members to test their popularity. Towards this end, he said the direct primary,  which was used successfully in Osun and Bauchi states, to pick candidates,  would henceforth be adopted by the APC. Oshiomhole said, “Somebody asked me are we countering the Peoples Democratic Party by offering automatic tickets,  I asked,  did we offer anybody departure ticket? If we did not, then how does the issue of return ticket arise? “For me, I am tired.  We just need to ensure every legislator who has value,  who is at home with his people,  that legislator is of value to the party and the party will do all to retain such. “Our party must consciously work to produce seasoned senators. We will get there.  If it took them 100 years to get there, we don’t have to take 50 years to get there. “I want to assure you that it can’t be argued that experience cannot be discarded.

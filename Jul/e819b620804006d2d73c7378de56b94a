President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday in Nouakchott, Mauritania called on nations where looted assets are stashed to release them without the usually long technicalities involved in the process of repatriation. He made the call during his introductory remarks as the leader of the African Union theme of the year, Winning the Fight against Corruption, A Sustainable Path to Africas Transformation, shortly before the commencement of the debate on the African Anti-Corruption Year. A statement by Special Adviser on Media and publicity Femi Adesina, quoted the   President as saying:  “We must all collectively work to place high on the agenda the need for open and participatory government, as well as the repatriation of stolen assets without procedural technicalities and legal obstacles.” President Buhari also appraised the anti-corruption efforts of his administration so far. “These workshops will be extended to other regional blocs as we continue the fight against corruption in a bid to transform our continent.” he said The President also informed the gathering of his intention to partner with the AU Chairperson to further push the frontiers of the anti-corruption battle: “I plan to convene the African Youth Congress in Abuja within the next quarter, and we will be working with the Chairman of the African Union, His Excellency, Paul Kagame and the Chairperson of the African Union Commission, to organize an Interactive Dialogue on the theme at the next session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York during the high level segment.”  Buhari urged member States to ratify the African Union Convention on Preventing and Combatting Corruption to take all necessary measures to sign and ratify it with a view to achieving its universal ratification during this calendar year as the Republic of Mauritius just did, becoming    the 40th State Party to the Convention. President Buhari said “the scourge of illicit financial flows continues to bite, eating back the gains and militating against the attainment of our aspirations under Agenda 2063 and the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda.”

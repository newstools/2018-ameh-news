Taraba State Governor, Darius Ishaku, has picked  nomination form from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to contest next year’s governorship election. He said he was waiting to see the candidates to challenge him from the other political parties. The governor’s special adviser on political matters, Abubakar Bawa who spoke in a press conference in Jalingo on behalf of the governor, said  there was nothing   to worry about. He said: “The governor is ready for whoever the oppositions will nominate to challenge him at the election. In 2015, the election was a two-horse race between the PDP and the APC. In the end, PDP won with a landslide. “PDP won because it presented the right candidate (Darius Ishaku). The same scenario seems to be playing out. We are only waiting to see the candidate APC will field this time around.” Bawa said although PDP is very democratic enough to welcome any governorship aspirant who may want to contest on the PDP’s platform, members however, have unanimously agreed that Ishaku should fly the party’s banner.

The Standards Organisation of Nigeria has unveiled four sets of standards to improve the quality of human resources in Nigeria. Speaking at the launch of the standards in Abuja, the Director General of SON, Osita Aboloma, said the new sets of standards were being introduced in Nigeria for the first time. The standards are Vocabulary in Human Resource Management (ISO 30400:2016), Guidelines on Recruitment in Human Resource Management (ISO 30405:2016), Guidelines in Governance in Resource Management (ISO 30408:2016) and Workforce Planning in Human Resource Management (ISO 30409:2016). He said the standards would aid the standardisation of skills being used in Nigeria as well as those exported out of the country. The SON boss said Nigeria needed to standardise its human resources to be able to compete in the global community. He said through the standards, only quality workers would be recruited to work in organisations. Aboloma added that henceforth, recruitment processes would be handled by only professionals in order to avoid sad incidents such as the botched Nigeria Immigration Service recruitment which led to loss of lives. The DG said twelve standards had been published globally by the International Organisation for Standards with another eight under development. According to him, four of the published standards have been ratified for implementation in Nigeria.

Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) National Commissioner, Mrs. Amina Zakari, has denied Governor Ayo Fayose’s allegation that she and three other officials have been hired by the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, to rig the July 14 governorship poll. She challenged Fayose and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to provide evidence to substantiate their claim, saying “it is impossible for an individual to rig election”. Zakari, who is the National Commissioner in charge of Election Operations and Logistics, said INEC is moving forward and getting better in conducting credible elections and “would not go back to bad old days”. She spoke in Ado-Ekiti alongside National Commissioner in charge of Ekiti, Osun and Oyo States, Prince Adedeji Soyebi at a Pre-Election Preparation workshop organised for Electoral Officers, Assistant Electoral Officers and Head of Departments. Zakari said: “They should prove that beyond reasonable doubt. I doubt it if an individual can rig an election when there are over 20,000 personnel to conduct the election.” “They should back their allegation with fact and figures. We (INEC) have nothing to hide. I see no reason why INEC would want to go back to bad old days. “We are moving for forward ever and we remain focused to ensure a credible election for Nigeria.”

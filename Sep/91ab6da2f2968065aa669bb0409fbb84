The ITU Telecom World 2018 concluded recently in Durban, South Africa following an action-packed week of debates, networking, showcasing and Awards. The event, which welcomed more than 3100 participants from 94 countries, brought together an impressive line-up of top-level government representatives, influential industry leaders – from established players to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and from emerging and developed markets alike. Among these were over 200 information and communication technology (ICT) leaders from 74 countries, including 33 ministers, and 125 SME exhibitors from across the globe. “This week we have seen some awe-inspiring showcases, featuring the types of cutting-edge innovations that are truly at the forefront of ICT development,” said ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao. “It is innovations such as these, plus the shared visions and knowledge of technology experts such as those present this week that have the potential to truly reach and connect the unconnected and help achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals.” In recognising the importance of the event being held in South Africa, Siyabonga Cyprian Cwele, Minister of Telecommunications and Postal Services for South Africa, said, “South Africa has been humbled by the honour of hosting this magnificent event and is grateful for the support it has received from the African countries and the rest of the world. We hosted this event in partnership with the private sector. The International Telecommunications Units (ITU) conference has provided an opportunity for Africa’s voice to be heard in important global ICT debates and discussions.

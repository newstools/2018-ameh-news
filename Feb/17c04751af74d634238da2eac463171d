Nigerian e-library startup, Panacea, has announced that it has launched an Android app version of the platform, which allows users to rent books, search for study mates and create book clubs. Panacea, which was launched for author registration and uploads in July 2017, has launched the beta version of its Android app which will see all the accepted research works, textbooks, novels, short stories, theses and professional texts available for rent via the new mobile app. “Panacea seeks to make learning fun and rewarding by making books more readily accessible to students, researchers and personal development enthusiasts while generating consistent revenue for authors and publishers through a global community of readers,” chief operating officer (COO) Philip Amiola told Disrupt Africa. “Our books are offered in an encrypted digital format that enhances a great reading experience while preventing piracy and duplication, thus guaranteeing maximum profit for authors and publishers,” according to Amiola The startup’s aim is to solve the problem of accessibility to and affordability of books and resources, giving users the flexibility to acquire knowledge from the comfort of their homes and offices. Panacea currently has around 150 user registrations on the platform from 5 different countries within and outside Africa. “We intend to attract authors and users from Africa and around the world in the coming months, especially African authors and readers,” said Amiola. The subscription-based platform does offer some free resources, but requires users to pay to access premium books and publications. The app is available for download on the Google Play Store.

  The Oyo State government yesterday shut 14 gaming centres in Ibadan, the state capital, for alleged tax defaults. The government, through its Board of Internal Revenue (OYBIR), enforced the law regulating such outlets in the metropolis. The areas affected include Sango, Mokola, Iwo Road, Awolowo Way, New Bodija, Beere, Molete and Challenge. Some of the centres found culpable are: Collabobet, Surebet247, 1960bet, Jackpot Pools and Dollars Pools. OYBIR Chairman Bicci Alli said the board was concerned about ensuring that organisations and business interests operating in the state comply with the tax laws governing their operations. Addressing reporters yesterday, Alli said it was high time the residents developed the culture of paying their taxes to the state and federal authorities. He said: “Basically, what we are doing is not different from what we are supposed to do. It is just that we are ensuring that people do what they are supposed to do and that what is due to Oyo State accrues to it.”

About 1,000 Nigerian youths have been trained by the Airbus Foundation in partnership with the Little Engineer and STEM METS Resources in aircraft manufacturing and assemblage. The goal of the programme is to encourage students to understand and embrace technology and ignite a passion that could grow into a career in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. The organisers of the training said they were interested in encouraging Nigerian youths, especially students, to embrace engineering and technology. They also said the training was to encourage females to develop interest in the aviation industry. The partners, at one of the trainings organised for 30 students at the Methodist Girls’ High School in Lagos on how to build and programme A380-scale model from scratch, said the trainees would also be made to understand the full take-off functionality of the aircraft. The Executive Director, Airbus Foundation, Andrea Debbane, expressed optimism that the workshop would encourage the youth to develop a career in the aviation industry. She said, “Having already trained more than 1,000 students in such a short time is a remarkable achievement. Investments in education and training are essential in building an educated and skilled workforce. “The goal of the Airbus youth development programme is to support the country’s efforts in creating a sustainable pipeline of talent for Africa.”

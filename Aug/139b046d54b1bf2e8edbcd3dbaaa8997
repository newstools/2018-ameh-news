 The Lagos State Government said it had credited N466.855m into the Retirement Savings Accounts of 187 of its retirees under the Contributory Pension Scheme for the month of July. According to a statement from the Lagos State Pension Commission, more retirees from the State Universal Basic Education Board benefitted from this batch of payment. During the presentation in Lagos, the Commissioner for Establishments, Training and Pensions, Dr Akintola Oke, stated that despite the scarcity of funds, the Lagos State Governor, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode, still holds the pensioners in high esteem by ensuring the release of funds every month for the payment of their entitlements. He said that 9,401 retirees had been paid about N38.5bn under the present administration. The Director General, LASPEC, Mrs Folasade Onanuga, advised retirees on the need to put their house in order for any eventuality by making sure they wrote their wills while still active. She urged them to be active in retirement, because the more they moved around, the better for their health. In appreciation, two of the retirees, Mr Orisayomi Olafemi and Mrs Adewole C.B, commended the efforts of the governor in accelerating the process of payment of retireesâ€™ entitlements, which they said could not be compared with what obtained in other states.

An online marketplace for cars in Nigeria, Cartalogs, has been unveiled in Lagos. The firm in a statement said it was keen on making the exploration, verification, buying, and selling of cars seamless and stress free. According to Cartalogs, the company puts its customers first by enhancing their car experiences and providing services that allow people live their lives without stress. “Over the last couple of years, we’ve been looking for a way to make lives easier for people, especially when buying cars,” Cartalogs Founder, Kelechi Idoko, said. “Our market research and interaction with people confirmed that people have become busier and crave for convenience when they want to buy, verify or sell cars. While we wanted to serve that fundamental human need, we also wanted to build a platform that is super easy to navigate and use, to truly enable people to live without stress. We must adopt a revolution where buying or selling a car should be as easy as ordering a taxi from your comfort zone,” he said. “This is an exciting journey for us and marks a strategic pivot in our future direction as a brand,” the Head of Operations, Ogbonna Ukwuaba, said.

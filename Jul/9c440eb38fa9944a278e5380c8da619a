PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari has hinted of plans to initiate special support scheme for people with disabilities. Buhari said this during a gala night organised by the ActionAid Nigeria in partnership with the Federal Ministry of Information and Culture to support the less-privileged through arts. It was held on Sunday night in Abuja to raise funds for the rural communities and the disabled persons. The President, who was represented by his Senior Special Assistant on Monitoring and Evaluation, Mr. Tunde Osibamowo, decried the social neglect of the vulnerable group. The President explained that plans were ongoing to organise a town hall meeting to get direct feedback from the targeted group. “A lot of people, who are vulnerable, have great artistic sense and particularly the disabled people. “Most definitely, at the moment, we are planning a lot of programmes and projects in the very near future for disabled people. They are not as well represented in a lot of government’s programmes. “Within the next few months, we are planning a lot of engagements for them,” Buhari said. According to him, a lot of disabled people are intelligent and resourceful and need to be supported.

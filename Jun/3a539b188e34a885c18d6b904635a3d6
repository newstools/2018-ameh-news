 A former Director of Nigeria’s National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS), Professor Aja Akpuru-Aja, says the implementation of the Treasury Single Account (TSA) and the Ease of Doing Business initiatives by the federal government are achieving the desired results on Nigeria’s economy. He said this in a paper entitled: “Building Transformative Leadership for Nigeria,”presented at The Big Idea Podium lecture series organised by the African Heritage Institution (Afri-Heritrage), in Enugu state. Professor Aja, who is currently with the International Relations and Political Science Department of Abia State University, said the TSA had helped the government and country to check multiple infractions in the country’s finances. “I must laud the vision and dexterity of the present administration to implement the TSA initiative, which had brought sanity and discipline into the nation’s finances. For now, uncoordinated financial withdrawals and running of government finances without discipline and accountability has stopped. People are now more responsible financially,” he said. According to him, with the TSA the country has been able to make substantial savings over time and can easily trace its monies. On the Ease of Doing Business initiative, Akpuru-Aja said the initiative had improved the country’s competitiveness as well as opened it up for business by relaxing all bottlenecks impeding businesses. “The present government is moving with a vision to get things right and correct negative ways of doing business, especially as it concerns government service agencies and commissions.I believe we are making progress in the right direction, which needed to be sustained,” he added.

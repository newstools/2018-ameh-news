Easter. “This commemoration is a time for deep reflection as it marks the sacrifice of Jesus Christ and his victory over death. It is a time to reach out to our brothers and sisters in need. “It is also a time for all of us, regardless of faith or ethnicity, to come together and pray for peace in our nation. We must all remain constant in efforts to promote unity across all lines because our nation will remain stronger when united.” Saraki also stressed the need for Nigerians to all play their part in the development of

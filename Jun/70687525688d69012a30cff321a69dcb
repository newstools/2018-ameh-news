UACN Property Development Company (UPDC) Plc has received regulatory approval to list its N4.355 billion bond on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) UPDC, a subsidiary of UAC of Nigeria (UACN) Plc, will be listing the N4.355 billion Series 1 Senior Guaranteed Fixed Rate Bond Due 2023 under its N20 billion Bond Issuance Programme. The listing by way of introduction will provide bondholders opportunity to trade on their investments and allow new investors to participate in the issue. UPDC has been leveraging on debts to fund its projects, after a slowdown in real estate market and stock market recession combined to shrink access to long-term capital. Attempt by the company to raise equity funds last year was only partially successful as it was only able to secure half of the funds it sought under the capital raising. UPDC paid a total of N2.83 billion as interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2016, which contributed significantly to the companyâ€™s net loss of N1.55 billion during the period. It had planned to use N3.0 billion from the N5.2 billion rights issue to repay debts.

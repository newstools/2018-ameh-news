Ngeria’s Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment says the Federal Government is taking adequate measures to accelerate the country’s industrialisation process through the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP). The Minister of the parastatal, Mr Okechukwu Enelamah, said this at the signing of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, UNIDO, 60 million dollars new Country Programme (CP) for Nigeria in Abuja, the nation’s capital. According to the Minister, the programme would cover nine areas, which include, industrial governance, research and statistics programme, and Micro Small and Medium Enterprises development programme. Enelamah said that UNIDO was encouraged by the success of the first Country Programme which paved way for the new programme. He said some of the achievements of the first programme, which ended in June 2018, included support to the development of the Nigeria Industrial Revolution Plan (NIRP) and capacity strengthening of the sector for its implementation. Others he said were the development of agribusiness and agro industry, and value chains with installation of modern rice milling equipment in Ebonyi and Benue among others. The Director-General, UNIDO, Mr Li Yong, who signed for his organisation said that the second signing of (CP) was important for Nigeria as the country strives toward achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 9 which focuses on building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialisation. He said the second (CP) was as a result of the success recorded from the first programme. According to him, UNIDO would collaborate with the ministry to mobilise funds and resources required to successfully implement the CP. It would be recalled that the ERGP, inaugurated in 2017, is a medium term all-round development initiative focused on restoring growth, investing in people and building a globally competitive economy.

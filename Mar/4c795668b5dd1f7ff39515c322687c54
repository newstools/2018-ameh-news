Senator Olabiyi Durojaiye, speaking at the Centre For Financial Journalism tagged with THE BULLION LECTURE with theme: The Wealth Of Nations And The Imperative Of Economic Transformation on Wednesday March 21, 2018 at the civic centre Lagos said my team in the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has set to work to ensure that Nigerian youth are trained to take active participation in the current Global Digital Communication Revolution. The senator Durojaiye who served as the Chairman of the event and the Chairman of the Board of Commissioners of the Nigerian Communications Commission pointed out that “Today, the world is entering into the FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION! Coal, Steam engines and electricity will not be the basic tools to drive the new Revolution. It is going to be the INTERNET and the TELECOMMUNICATION industry. Plans are already on the drawing boards for the 5G digital communication maverick including Internet of Things (IoD) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) The senator said the subject of the lecture: THE WEALTH OF NATIONS reminds me of the title of the book published by Mr Adam Smith at the begging of the Industrial Revolution in Britain in the 18th century. Talking of the “imperative of Economic transformation” is a most appropriate subject for discussion and action in the present day Nigeria and in order developing countries.

If we look at four or five countries to our West, four or five to our East and at least two countries immediately North of Nigeria, we will find that more of them and indeed all of them put together do not have our size in population, the quality of our manpower, our bounteous minerals and agricultural resources etc, etc.” Often times, he said we heap our difficulties on our governments never admitting that we as a people are not responsive to the people who lead us but also contribute majorly to their failures.

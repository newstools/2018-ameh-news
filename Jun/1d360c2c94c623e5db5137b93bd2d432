The sectoral by sectoral analysis shows that significant proportion of inventory of unsold manufactured goods was observed in  the Basic Metal, Iron & Steel Fabricated Metal group (N31.39 billion or 19.4 percent); Chemical and Pharmaceutical sector (N25.87 billion or 16.0 percent): Food, Beverage and Tobacco (N20.7 billion or 12.8  percent); and Domestic/Industrial Plastic, Rubber & Foam (N20.54 billion or 12.7 percent).  Also inventory of unsold finished goods in Basic Metal, Iron & Steel Fabricated Metal stood at N31.39 billion in the review period from N5.53 billion recorded in the corresponding half of 2016: thereby indicating N25.85 billion increases over the period.

Inventory of unsold goods in Ogun zone stood at N60.59 billion in the period under review from N6.07 billion recorded in corresponding half of 2016; thus indicating N54.52 billion increase over the period.  It however declined by N5.77 billion when compared with N66.36 billion recorded in the preceding half.   Inventory of unsold goods in the zone totaled N126.95 billion in 2017 as against N16.94 billion recorded in 2016; thereby indicating N110.01 billion increase over the period.  “The high inventory of unsold manufactured goods in Ogun was ascribed to the poor road network in the zone; and the fact that most heavy industries in Nigeria such as iron and steel, cement as well as plastics are located in the zone.  These industries also exhibited high inventory of unsolved manufactured goods in the period under review.”  The Photo Caption: The President, Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), Dr Franks Udemba Jacobs

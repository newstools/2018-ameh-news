The Nigeria Employers’ Consultative Association has kicked against the closure of offices and business premises of Nigeria Breweries Plc across the nation by the Director-General of the National Lottery Regulatory Commission, Mr Lanre Gbajabiamila. NECA said that Gbajabiamila’s action had failed to respect the ongoing suit – CA/A/207/2016, NECA & 1 or vs. AG Federation & 3 others – which is connected to the issue that allegedly prompted the closure of the Nigeria Breweries. It added that the court, since 2016, had directed parties in the case to maintain status quo ante. The Director-General of NECA, Mr Olusegun Oshinowo, said, “I am still in shock that the new helmsman at the NLRC would go all out to act in breach of the rule of law and utter contempt of court by shutting down the offices and business premises of Nigeria Breweries Plc in a case still before the Court of Appeal. “Since 2016 when the case was filed in court, the past leadership of the commission had exercised restraint and due respect for the law of the land.” He said, “It is unthinkable that a public servant would rashly shut down business premises of a multi-billion dollar investment without considering the dire implications on the economy.” Oshinowo, therefore, called on the Presidency and the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment to call Gbajabiamila to order, saying his actions were not only illegal, unlawful and ultra vires, “but were counterproductive to the laudable efforts of the Federal Government in improving the ease of doing business in Nigeria. “He should be called to order to avoid further damage to business and the fragile economy at large,” he added.

 A total of N1.938 trillion was disbursed by Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) to all tiers of government in the first quarter of 2018. This is an increase of 37.3% on the N1.411trillion disbursed in the first quarter of 2017 and 71.1% higher than the N1.132 trillion disbursed in the first quarter of 2016. According to report total disbursements to the three tiers of government by FAAC can be seen that all tiers of government experienced an increase in disbursements. For instance the total disbursements to the Federal Government stood at N812.8 billion in the first quarter of 2018, representing a 48% increase over the N549.1 billion disbursed in the first quarter of 2017 and 69% higher than the N480.2 billion disbursed in first quarter of 2016. While the total disbursements to state governments in the first quarter of 2018 amounted to N683.4 billion, a 49.8% increase over the N455.9 billion disbursed in the first quarter of 2017 and a 76.1% increase on the amount of N388.1 billion disbursed in the first quarter of 2016. And the figures disbursed to local government areas anchored on a total of N393.3 billion in the first quarter of 2018. These represents 46% and 67% higher than the N269.4 billion and N235.3 billion disbursed in the first quarters of 2017 and 2016 respectively. These higher disbursements in the first quarter of 2018, if maintained, indicate bright prospects for higher revenues for the rest of the year. The further breakdown showed a total Net Disbursements to States Ranged between N4.99 billion and N50.88 billion. The FAAC disbursements to states in the first quarter of 2018 showed Osun State received the lowest net disbursement of N4.99 billion while Akwa Ibom State received the highest of N50.44 billion. This implies that Akwa Ibom State received 920% of what Osun State received. These figures reveal there was wide disparity in the amounts received by different states from FAAC. Three broad categories can be identified are: Five states that received less than N10 billion of allocation are Osun, Cross River, Ekiti, Zamfara and Ogun states. Notably, three of these five states are in the South West (Osun, Ekiti and Ogun), one is from the South South which is (Cross River) and one is from the North West which is (Zamfara). While 26 states that received allocation fund between N10.1 billion and N20 billion are as follows Plateau, Gombe, Kwara, Ebonyi, Taraba, Nasarawa, Adamawa, Enugu, Kogi, Yobe, Sokoto, Imo, Kebbi, Benue, Bauchi, Anambra, Abia, Niger, Oyo, Katsina, Jigawa, Borno, Ondo, Edo, Kaduna and Kano states. And five states that received above N20 billion are Lagos, Bayelsa, Rivers, Delta, and Akwa Ibom states respectively. Interestingly, of these five states that received above N20 billion, only Lagos State is not from the oil producing South-South region. The report noted that such disparities in FAAC disbursements suggest differences in revenue capacities of different states. This would be expected to play a role in expenditure (budget) decisions of various states. For instance, states with lower disbursements from FAAC ordinarily would be expected to have lower budgets and states with high FAAC disbursements would be expected to have higher budgets. But not so, as the approved and proposed budgets for various states are seen to be different always. For example, Cross River which received the second lowest disbursement (N8.41 billion) in the first quarter has the largest budget proposal (N1.3 trillion). While Osun State that received the lowest disbursement (4.99 billion) in the first quarter has the 18th largest budget proposal (N173.9 billion). These states, according to expert in budget analysis said would have to put a lot of efforts into generating internal revenue or would have to resort to borrowing to stand a chance of implementing their budgets.

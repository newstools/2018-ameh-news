 Fidelity Bank has alerted the public to an attempt to bring its image to disrepute, and that it had reported the matter to the authorities. According to a statement from the bank, “Our attention has been drawn to spurious allegations against the bank and its officials, making the rounds online and on social media”. “The unsubstantiated claims and accusations, designed to mislead the banking and general public are completely false, treacherous and libelous. “This latest attempt to bring the image of the bank to disrepute is the result of a failed blackmail and extortionist attempt, which has been reported to the authorities. We urge the public to disregard the falsehood in its entirety! “As a full-fledged commercial bank, operating in Nigeria, we are a responsible corporate citizen and our operations are guided by the laws of the land as well as local and international banking standards. “At Fidelity Bank, we remain committed to providing excellent banking services to all and will not be distracted by the antics of these detractors”.

The general poor macroeconomic and business environment is associated with failures of economic policies over the years. Nigeria Economic policies have failed at virtually every stage of the policy management process due to the following areas: (i) lack identification and articulation of the problem, (ii) the planner lack specification of the objectives and targets, (iii) there was no design of strategies and policy instruments, (iv) always lack implementation capability, (v) no evaluation of policies, and (vi) feedback from every policy formulation. The above listed conditions have throw up challenges of economic and industrial policies in the country.

 Activist lawyer Femi Falana (SAN) has urged Plateau State Governor Simon Lalong  to arrest and prosecute all those connected with the recent killings of over 80 people in the state. He made the request in a letter sent to the governor dated June 26, 2018 and titled: “Request for the arrest and prosecution of the murder of 86 unarmed people”. Falana said since a group has already claimed responsibility for the heinous crime, he was compelled to request the governor to order the Police to arrest and investigate the suspects. He said if the governor does not take appropriate action to stop the killings in Plateau state, he would  report  the Federal Government and the Plateau State government to the Special Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) for condoning crimes against humanity and genocide. The erudite lawyer sympathized with the Government and people of Plateau over the reckless and cold murder of 86 unarmed people in Razat, Ruku, Nyarr, Kura and Gana-Ropp villages of Gashi District in Barkin Ladi Local Government in Plateau State. He appreciated the measures adopted by the governor to restore law and order in the affected local government. He, however, emphasized that it is high time that the brazen impunity of the serial murderers in Plateau State was challenged by the State Government. “Otherwise, the reckless killing of unarmed citizens by  criminal gangs will continue unabated”, he said.

The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) incurred a loss to the tune of N240,304,755,518 as under-recovered expenditure in importing petrol at the international market price and selling at the federal government’s regulated pump price of N145 per litre between March 2017 and March 2018, a period of 13 month. This is contained in the corporation’s monthly financial report which showed that 80.26 million litres of petrol was consumed in March 2018, also indicated that in February 2018, Nigeria’s oil production volumes declined by about 7.588 million barrels on account of multiple production shut-ins mostly on crude oil export terminals and pipelines. Under-recovery is another term to describe subsidy, which arises as a result of the difference between the landing cost of refined products and the official prices. The corporation in its March 2018 financial and operations report – the latest so far, indicated that it lost N240.3 billion for keeping petrol pump price at N145 per litre at that period, and this loss represents the amount that should be paid to it afterwards as petrol subsidy claims, assuming the federal government is still operating the subsidy regime.

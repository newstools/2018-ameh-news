The management of the fidelity bank plc, has stated their position on the false claim stemming from the video post that went viral online saying “Our attention has been drawn to a social media video featuring an assault on two people at a Fidelity Bank branch in Lagos. The statement pointed out that the two individuals featured in the video were suspected of ‘shoulder surfing’ to steal customer card details at the ATM. The security personnel on duty interceded and they attacked and injured him before the intervention of the Mobile Policemen who are seen in the video. Therefore, No Fidelity Bank official ordered any violence against customers as alleged and there was no incidence of the Branch ATM not dispensing cash, the report added. According to the statement, the matter has been reported to the Police and the suspects have been handed over for prosecution. While management re-assured general public that the Fidelity Bank is customer-centric and we remain committed to providing easy and convenient banking and financial services in a safe environment for our customers and the banking public.

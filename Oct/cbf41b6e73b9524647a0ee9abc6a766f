The bank’s gross earnings for the quarter stood at NGN110.59 billion — 16% above similar period last year, but 6% lower compared to the previous quarter. Interest income declined in the quarter by 7% q/q, as against the marginal growth recorded in Q2. The uptick in fixed income yields (Q2-18: 12.97% vs. Q3-18: 13.25%) is yet to impact, as interest earned on investment securities was down 6% during the quarter. While interest on customer loans in the Q3 declined by 4% q/q, amidst the continued decline in the bank’s loan book. Coupled with an increased interest expense (+3% y/y, flat q/q) in the quarter, net interest income was lower by 9% q/q and 12% y/y, while NIM printed at 9.03% — 147 bps lower than 10.5% recorded in FY-17. Meanwhile, growth in non-interest income for the quarter turned negative, as NIR dropped 6% q/q (Q2-18: +31%q/q), while it surged 169% on a y/y basis. The q/q decline was largely on the back of 14% decline in other income. Meanwhile net fees & commission income rose 4% q/q, but the disappointing performance in Q2 muted the growth, leading to a flat y/y performance in the 9M-2018 result. On the positive, loan recoveries in the quarter led to a net gain in loan impairment charges, even as the bank’s loan book (-2% q/q) continued to contract. Cost of risk in the 9M-18 accounts stood at 0.12%, compared to the 0.76% recorded in FY-17. Also, NPL ratio decreased to 5.57% vs. 7.66%. It is also worth stating that the continued decline in loans (-12% YtD), coupled with sustained increase in deposits (+9%), has contributed to the decline in loan-to-deposit ratio to 48.21% vs. 58.91% in FY-17. Total operating expenses was lower by 12% q/q, amidst absence of AMCON charges in the quarter which had been deducted in H1. However, in the 9-months accounts, total opex is up 13% y/y, while cost-to-income ratio stands at stands at 38% (vs. 9M-2017: 36% and FY-17: 37%). Overall, the bank’s performance in the Q3-18 period was impressive, with top and bottom lines posting 16% and 11% y/y growth, respectively. The NGN142.2bn net profit reported as at 9M-18, on an annualized basis, is above consensus’ estimate for the full year by 7%. The bank’s stock closed positive in today’s trading session, but has lost 10% YtD. We do not expect negative reaction to the bank’s result in tomorrow’s session. GTB remains among our top picks, with a TP of NGN52.45 – 42% above today’s closing price of NGN37.

 An Access Bank Plc’s customer has emerged one of the winners in the Western Union year-end promotional campaign. As a result, the customer was presented with a brand new car at an event in Lagos. The Head, Remittances, Access Bank, Funmilayo Afolabi, who witnessed the gift presentation, said the gesture would go a long way in encouraging existing and potential customers to participate in future promos. She added that the programme would also encourage saving culture among the citizenry. Access Bank was among the lenders which participated in the promo which ran last year. Afolabi said, “I manage all the remittance products in Access Bank. This promotion is highly appreciated. “It shows that when you reward customers, it will encourage and motivate more people to participate in future promos, knowing they could also win.” The money transfer company had ran a year-end promo last year and promised to give new cars to winners that would emerge. Four of the cars had been given out; the remaining two were given out on Friday to the two winners, one of which came from Access Bank. Afolabi said the promo was meant to encourage people to use Western Union to send money to their loved ones outside Nigeria. According to her, the latest gift presentation has brought to a close the 2017 promo programmes of the Western Union. The winner of the brand new car, Tope Johnson, who flew in from Abuja, expressed gratitude to the bank

 The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has arraigned a suspended judge of the Federal High Court, Justice Mohammed Yunusa, for alleged corruption. Justice Yunusa, alongside one Esther Agbo, who works in the law firm of Rickey Tarfa & Co., was arraigned on Wednesday before the Lagos State High Court in Ikeja. In the five charges filed by the EFCC, the embattled judge was accused of collecting N1.5m from Agbo’s boss, Mr. Rickey Tarfa (SAN), for the purpose of giving judgments favourable to the SAN’s law firm. Justice Yunusa was also accused of engaging in constant private and confidential communications with Tarfa, who was handling three lawsuits marked FHC/L/CS/714/2015, FHC/L/CS/715/2015 and FHC/L/CS/716/2015 before him.

 The Co-Founder, Heart and Capital Nigeria Limited, Mr. Umar Adelodun, has said that the attacks of farmers by herdsmen and the destruction of farmlands by cattle is aggravating food insecurity in Nigeria. He identified agriculture as sector that could boost industrialisation through production of raw materials. He added that agriculture could provide employment and engagement of thousands of unemployed graduates as well as boost the nation’s Gross Domestic Product. Speaking on Thursday in Ilorin during the inauguration of Heart and Capital Nigeria Limited, Adelodun also said proper investment in agriculture would diversify Nigeria’s economy from oil. He said the company would offer some services such as professional farm management and farm consultancy. According to him, this prompted the establishment of Heart and Capital Farm Estate located in the outskirts of Ilorin, Kwara State. He said with this platform, individuals and corporate organisations could engage in farming themselves in a good environment or do proxy farming with high return on investment. Adelodun said, “We appeal to the Federal Government to find a way to cure the menace of herdsmen. These people are destroying lives and property.  This will weaken the nation’s food security. “If agriculture is truly the future, we need to treat it as the future. So the government needs to curb this menace and strengthen food security.”

The Managing Director, Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG), Mr. Tony Attah, while at the Offshore Technology Conference (OTC) 2018, said NLNG is at the forefront of gas commercialisation and monetisation, adding that NLNG was set up to end gas flaring and monetise gas resources. The inability of oil producers to derive sufficient economic benefits from the utilisation or production of associated gas has been a source of concern to stakeholders in the country’s oil and gas industry. He said the whole world flares about 140 billion cubic meters which is almost about 5tcf of gas on an annual basis which is more than 700 billion kilowatts hour sufficient to power the whole of Africa over and over again.

He said Russia remains in the first position of gas flaring nations in the world, flaring 15 per cent of total gas flared in the world, adding that Nigeria was in the second position, but between 2006 and 2016, Nigeria progressed to the seventh position, stating that the US flares more gas than Nigeria. Attah disclosed further that Nigeria is now behind Iraq, Iran, Venezuela and Russia, saying Nigeria has moved from more than one trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas being flared to within 300 billion cubic feet, which is equivalent to about $800 million being burnt away on an annual basis. He said; ‘‘The reason I am at this conference is to tell operators that we should stop gas flaring. Though we are not directly involved on the supply side in the value chain but on the demand side, we are by far the biggest receptacle of gas in Nigeria. Of the eight bcf of gas produced in Nigeria, we take about 3.5bcf on a daily basis and we have capacity to take more. Our vision is to help build a better Nigeria by ending gas flaring and monetising gas as the biggest resource in Nigeria.”

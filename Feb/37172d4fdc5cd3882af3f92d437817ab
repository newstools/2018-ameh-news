Jordi Borrut Bel,  Managing Director/CEO, Nigerian Breweries PlcThe management of the Nigerian Breweries Plc (NB) in its results published for the period and year ended 31 December 2017. The results shown gross debt of N8.5 billion as at December 31, and while it is expect new Commercial Paper (CP) issuances is expected in this year, has modeled interest expenses to halve in 2018F, on expected reduced working capital pressure (suggesting debt issuance will be relatively modest) and lower interest rates. According to the results, the year end’s net sales and earnings grew 9.8% and 16.3% respectively. On the record that Q4-17 net sales declined 1% y/y while net earnings grew by 9% (but 24% behind our estimate for the period). The fall out of the results has made some analysts to said that the 2018-2019 first quarter EBITDA and net profit forecasts by 3% each, reflecting mainly the downward revision of gross margin estimates. On estimates, NB currently trades on 2018F P/E and EV/EBITDA multiples of 24.4x and 10.2x respectively, relative to MEA peer averages of 22.4x and 9.5x respectively. Despite the miss in Q4 (6% below the expert estimate), the opinion is that sales revenue will growth for 2018 first quarter by 200 bps to 7%, taking into consideration potential price hike in the wake of the recently proposed excise tariff increase. That is to said, management’s outlook for 2018 is cautious from macro view point, and amidst a more intense competitive environment. But whilst the economy (new mainstream) segment is expected to continue to underpin group volume, management however did acknowledge signs of moderating consumer down-trading, specifically confirmed by Heineken’s (an international premium brand) return to growth. According to the market watchers, the gross margin is estimated for 2018 to deep by 100 bps to 43%, following the miss in Q4. Notwithstanding the moderating inflation and stable FX outlook, management did not sound convincing to us vis-à-vis material improvement in gross margin in 2018. With EBIT margin estimated equally lowered to 18% (previously 18.95%). The analysts stated that management does not anticipate FX-related losses in Q1 2018 (-33% in 2017FY to NGN5 billion), given the sizeable clearance of USD-denominated trade payables in 2017, and the expectation of continued healthy FX liquidity.

President Muhammadu Buhari on Sunday arrived in Morocco, on a two-day working visit to the country. The visit, which is at the invitation of His Royal Majesty, King Mohammed VI, will see the two leaders discuss socio-economic matters affecting their countries. Discussions between the two leaders will focus on strengthening existing agreements on the fertilizer industry, education cooperation, the Nigeria-Morocco Gas Pipeline project and establishing a basic chemical platform to harness Nigeria’s vast natural gas resources and support Morocco’s diammonium phosphate industry. President Buhari is accompanied on the trip by Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State, Abubakar Badaru of Jigawa State and other senior government officials. The Moroccan King had paid a similar visit to Nigeria in December 2016, where the bond of unity among the two nations was further cemented.

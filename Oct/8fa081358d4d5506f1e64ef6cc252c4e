The President, Dangote Group, Aliko Dangote, has initiated a new project aimed at celebrating hardworking homemakers. The project, tagged the World Puff-puff Day, is to be celebrated on October 27 every year, according to Dangote Flour Mills. Two tonnes (40 bags of 50-kilogramme) flour were used at the maiden edition of the event, which held on Saturday, with 30,000 pieces of puff-puff produced. The Group Marketing Executive, Dangote Flour Mills, Mrs Funmilayo Bolarinwa, said the firm aimed to beat the current Guinness Book of World Records of 200kg (four big bags) of flour fried at a particular location. “We brought over 50 confectioners selected from different parts of Lagos to fry different flavours and varieties of puff-puff, including pepper, vanilla, coconut and other flavours,” she said. On the sidelines of the event, the Executive Director, Dangote Flour Mills, Halima Dangote, said the festival was the firm’s way of giving back to the community. Halima added, “Next year, we will involve all our competitors like Flour Mills of Nigeria and others, because the puff-puff is the common delicacy that connects us. “Everyone at this festival is guaranteed unlimited supply of puff-puff and we have a master class with Chef Eros, who will teach people how to make puff-puff in the comfort of their homes.” The Chief Executive Officer, Dangote Flour Mills, Thabo Mabe, said that the festival was the most current and important event for the company, because it was a way of supporting households that baked bread and other pastries with the Dangote brands. “We are introducing 1.5kg of flour so that every household in Nigeria can have access to flour to make puff-puff, which is Nigeria’s beloved eat-and-go snack,” he stated. The event featured a brief appearance by Aliko Dangote.

 President Muhammadu Buhari has reportedly told the governors elected under the platform of the All Progressives Congress, APC, to support the candidacy of former Governor of Edo State, Adams Oshiomhole for the party’s National Chairmanship position. Buhari on Tuesday evening met behind closed door with the APC governors at the Presidential Villa. A Presidency official told Punch after the meeting that the sole item on the agenda of the meeting was how the governors would work towards the emergence of Oshiomhole as the party’s national chairman. APC will hold its national convention on May 14, 2018 in Abuja. It is not certain whether the party’s current chairman, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun will be seeking re-election. Punch quoted the presidency official as saying, “The President called this meeting with the APC governors to ask them to back Oshiomhole’s candidature. “That’s the purpose of the meeting; that is the President ’s position.” The APC has decided to retain the current zoning formula for its national offices. Oyegun and Oshiomhole are both from Edo State in the South-South where the party’s Chairmanship position is zoned to.

The National Directorate of Employment (NDE) is to collaborate with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to raise about N17.7 billion for its ‘50 under 35 Project’ aimed at empowering young businessmen and women in all senatorial zones of the country. The NDE is also planning to partner the National Youths Council of Nigeria (NYCN) to train about 3, 700 youths in the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory. Its Director-General Dr. Nasir Ladan Mohammed, who made this known when the president of NYCN, Comrade Bello Bala Shagari, led other leaders of the group on a visit, said 50 youths who are under 35 and have businesses are the project’s prime target. Ladan said each of the youth would access up to N3 million from the money when it becomes available to boost their businesses and reposition them to provide employment to others. He said the NDE was established mainly to help train Nigerians in different areas and be employers rather than waiting for government to provide jobs. He said: “We are ready to partner any group as far as unemployment is concerned in this country. As such we are going to train about 100 youths, each from the 36 states and the FCT, making it about 3, 700. So, I urge you to send their names to us. “We are going to train for you and we are also going to settle them for you. This is because we will make sure unemployment is reduced in the country.” Speaking on the forthcoming general elections, Ladan urged the youth to mobilise their members to take advantage of the ongoing voters’ registration so as not to be disfranchised. He advised them against being used by politicians as thugs to disrupt the process of electioneering in the country.

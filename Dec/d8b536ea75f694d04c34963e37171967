The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Federal Operation Unit (FOU), Zone A, Ikeja,  has impounded 66 trucks loaded with foreign rice , 34 vehicles, 3,79kilogrammes of Indian hemp and other contraband valued at N2.75billion. Comptroller Aliyu Mohammed told reporters yesterday, that two suspects were arrested over the smuggling of Indian hemp valued at N379.2million. He said the bags of Indian hemp were smuggled inot the country from Ghana by unscrupulous Nigerians. Also, he noted that between August 17 and December 10, 2018,  FOU intercepted various contraband with a duty paid value (DPV) of N5.1billion. He listed the seized items to include: “24 units of seized vehicles and 34 exotic vehicles on detention (58), 39,664 bags of foreign parboiled rice (equivalent of 66 trailers), 3,252 frozen poultry products, 2,887 jerry cans of vegetable oil, 3,792 parcels of Indian hemp, 5x20feet containers of unprocessed wood, 2,520 bales of used clothing, 710 cartons of tramadol, 510 kilogrammes of pangolin packed in 17 sacks, 180 pieces of compressors, among others. “The 58 vehicles under detention/seizure are: 3bullet proof vehicles including 1 Lexus Jeep LX570 (2016) and 2 Land Cruiser Jeeps (2017/2018), 6 Toyota Camry, other vehicles include: 2 Toyota Hilux (2017), 2 Toyota Land Cruiser (2016), 2 Nissan Navara (2016) among others.” The comptroller stressed that  the anti-smuggling units also intercepted some motorcycles laden with bags of rice from unapproved routes, creeks and border communities. Mohammed  said: “ The drive and desire to compliment the Comptroller General’s policy of entrenching transparency and integrity while enforcing the core mandate of the service is the determining factor for his uncompromising stand to succeed at all cost. Speaking on seizures of rice, the comptroller said proactive steps of enforcement were  achieving the desired result. He said the agency was working in line with the policy of the Federal Government in sustaining agriculture and self-sufficiency in food production, revamping the economic recovery plan, protecting national security and ameliorating the potential health hazards of the negative impact of smuggled items to the average citizens. Mohammed said as a unit that requires and ensure total compliance to all clearance procedure and extant laws, the non-compliance of stakeholders who chose to abuse these procedures would always fall victims of FOU. He said the greatest new year gift the FOU Zone A was offering Nigerians was the modest contribution of sacrifice that officers and men went through to combat the menace of these illicit substances.

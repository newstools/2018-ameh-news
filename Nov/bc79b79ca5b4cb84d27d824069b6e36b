The Head of Civil Service of the Federation, Mrs Winifred Oyo-Ita, has urged the Risk Managers Society of Nigeria to work closely with the government in militating against risks in the country. She stated this while declaring open the 2018 National Risk Management confab in Abuja with the theme, ‘Risk management and nation building – transforming national challenges to opportunities’. “Government certainly needs your support as risk managers to effectively pre-empt most of the national challenges, be it natural disasters like flash floods ravaging several parts of the country or other socio-economic problems,” Oyo-Ita said. She said that the application of risk management solutions to the wide spectrum of national challenges had huge potential for proffering solutions that could prevent or turn those adversities to opportunities. According to her, the task of nation building was a collective one, which should address the challenges of the country in their diverse forms. The President, RIMSON, Mr Jacob Adeosun, while reviewing the recent activities of RIMSON, drew attention to the society’s objectives, especially the quest towards making RIMSON the hub of risk management education in Nigeria and ultimately in the West African sub-region through the establishment of the Centre for Risk Management Development. He noted that the CRMD was approved by the Federal Ministry of Education as the training, education and research arm of RIMSON. Adeosun cited the society’s publication of a magazine, The Risk Management Digest, which was presented to the public during the official opening of the conference. According to him, the magazine boasts of a rich collection of learned articles across a wide spectrum of disciplines. The president called for more collaboration in the task of making risk management a culture in Nigeria.

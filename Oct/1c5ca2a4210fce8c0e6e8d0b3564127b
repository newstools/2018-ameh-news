The Nigerian-American Chamber of Commerce (NACC) in collaboration with the Bervidson Group has concluded its one-day Business Process Improvement (BPI) training for stakeholders drawn from various industries and businesses. Speaking with The Nation after the training, which held in Lagos, during the week, Bervidson Group President Joseph Ebata said no BPI initiative would last without being sustained by an improvement culture driven by training. Ebata, who said organisations were struggling to survive in the face of many challenges, noted that they must constantly innovate to become more competitive and also meet customers’ changing expectations. According to him, about 85 per cent of reasons for not meeting customers’ expectations are related to deficiencies in systems and processes rather than employees. Ebata, therefore, argued that for organisations to succeed, they must constantly seek to improve their business processes to be more responsive to the changing expectation of today’s customers. The workshop, he noted, focused on how organisations could improve their processes, product/service quality, and reduce costs significantly in order to increase effectiveness and efficiency without compromising customer satisfaction. According to him, the workshop employed the eight-step problem solving processes using the ‘Plan-Do-Check-Act’ and ‘Cause & Effect’ BPI models to show how discerning organisations seeking to innovate their processes for greater effectiveness, efficiency and competitiveness, could successfully move from their current state to the desired state. The Director-General, Nigerian-American Chamber of Commerce, Joyce Akpata, said organisations are seeking to innovate and optimise their current processes to increase competitiveness, productivity, employee engagement, customer satisfaction and reduced costs. The DG said it was therefore, important for the Chamber to organise a workshop that addresses the concerns and needs of organisations while at the same time pointing them towards successfully undertaking result-oriented business process improvement projects.

The Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria has released the list of what it calls delinquent debtor firms who allegedly owe it N906,109,840,662.99 in total. In an advertorial published on Monday, the bad debt manager said the list contained the top 105 delinquent debtors and that the publication was pursuant to its statutory mandate and in compliance with the circular issued by the Central Bank of Nigeria in April 2015. “This has become necessary as all avenues provided by the corporation for the debtors to propose acceptable resolution terms have failed.

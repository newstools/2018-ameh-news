The Kano State Government says it has provided land for the construction of a mega gas pipeline from Ajaokuta to Kano. The Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Alhaji Usman Alhaji, said this on Wednesday in Kano while receiving a delegation from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) which paid him a courtesy visit in his office. He said the state government had also provided land for the construction of 135 megawatts hydro power project initiated by the state government as part of efforts to boost socio-economic activities in the state. Alhaji said that the power project, when completed, would enable the state to compete with other states like Lagos and Ogun in terms of economic development. He said that Kano State would continue to provide the necessary support and logistics for the successful execution of the two projects. The Chairman of Kano State Land Use Allocation Committe, Alhaji Ibrahim Danâ€™azumi, said that the 614 Kilometer gas pipeline project, the first of its kind in the country, would boost the economy of the state, especially the industrial sector. He commended the NNPC and other development partners for their contributions and commitment toward the actualisation of the two projects in the state. A representative of NNPC, Alhaji Muhammad Sani SoronDinki, said preparation had been completed for the commencement of the two projects. He commended Kano State Government for its support and cooperation toward the realisation of the two projects, which he said, would go a long way in boosting economic activities in the state.

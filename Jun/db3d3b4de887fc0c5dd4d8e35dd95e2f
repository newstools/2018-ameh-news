Governor Samuel Ortom has stated that no matter how long it takes, ranching will eventually be accepted by the people of Nigeria. He spoke on Monday in Naka, Gwer West Local Government Area during the traditional marriage between his friend, Architect Asema Achado and Princess Freda Nguamo Damna. He cited resolutions of the Northern and Southern Governor’s fora, National Economic Council as well as the most recent enactment of the law by the Abia State Government as indications that ranching was inevitable in the 21st century. The Governor stated, “Just like the case of the June 12 presidential election, it took 25 years for the federal government to officially acknowledge that Moshood Kashimawo Abiolo won the presidential election.” He commended President Buhari for the courage to acknowledge the truth and urged him to accept the same principle in the matter of ranching. Governor Ortom stated that his concern for now was for peace to return to Benue communities more than any other thing else He charged couples to be faithful to their marital vows, even as he pledged to support people of the state to fulfil marital obligations.

adiza Usman Bala, NPA MD The Nigerian Ports Authority has updated the list of Government agencies allowed to stay and function within the ports, bringing to eight, the total figure, following the recent Federal Government endorsement of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC). Ironically, while the NAFDAC was celebrating its inclusion in the team to stay in the ports, specifically to checkmate the importation of tramadol, codeine related drugs and other dangerous drugs, freight forwarders and importers were sulking that the approval may further hike the cost of cargo clearing in the ports. The NPA General Manager Corporate and Strategic Communications, Abdullahi Goje who broached on the subject has subsequently cautioned any agency still loitering within the ports environment, without being a part of the eight to give way without delay, stressing that the Authority would strenuously act in line with a directive from the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, in furtherance of the overall aim to make the Ease of Doing Business vision effective. The updated list of eight comprised of the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS), Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Nigeria Police Force, Department of State Security (DSS), Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS) and the Port Health. “As part of efforts to improve efficiency in port operations, the Vice President and chairman of the Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council, Professor Yemi Osinbajo has directed the Nigerian Ports Authorityto ensure that only eight federal government agencies are allowed to operate and have physical representation at all port locations in the country”, indicated Goje, advising every other agency to vacate the ports premises and carry out their regulatory functions from outside the port locations. “The NPA remains committed to the determination of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration to enhance ease of doing business and improve conditions under which business is carried out in all ports locationsacross the country”, he admonished further, while soliciting the support of all agencies and stakeholders in the Nigerian maritime sector towards actualising the goal of making Nigeria a preferred hub for West and Central Africa.

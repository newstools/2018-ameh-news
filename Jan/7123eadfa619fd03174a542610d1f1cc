 The President, Dangote Industries, Aliko Dangote, has announced the donation of a N1.2bn structure for the running of the business school of the Bayero University, Kano. The building, which will be handed over to the university management next month, according to a statement on Sunday, is a state-of-the-art edifice and will mark the commencement of the business school in the institution and the first in the northern part of the country. Dangote is also building a similar business school in the University of Ibadan, which will be inaugurated soon. Tnhe business schools being undertaken by the Aliko Dangote Foundation, according to Dangote, are parts of efforts to build entrepreneurship in the sub-consciousness of Nigerians through education at the highest level. He explained that the situation Nigeria had found itself necessitated revisiting school curricula to reflect the new consciousness of entrepreneurship and manufacturing, and efforts made to encourage the study of business, especially at the second level in the universities. The BUK business school comprises of auditoriums, lecture theatres, offices, classes, library, and complete electrical fittings and cooling system, among others. Speaking on the gesture of Africa’s richest man, the Dean of Faculty, Dangote Business School, BUK, Prof. Murtala Sagagi, said there was no business school in the institution until Dangote started the project. “We have an ambition to have a business school and we could not go ahead with the project, because there was no befitting structure to accommodate the kind of dream we had; but with Dangote coming in about five years ago, that was when the university decided to say this is the time to have the business school,” he stated.

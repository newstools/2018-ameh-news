The African Development Bank President, Adeniyi Adesina, has said the lender has provided trade finance lines of credit of $900 million trade finance mitigation support to promote Afreximbank’s trade finance activities. Adesina said with the rapidly changing world of trade and rising echoes of unilateralism, Africa must trade smartly, starting by ensuring rapid growth in Intra-African trade. Speaking in Abuja during a dinner organised to mark the 2018 Annual Meetings and 25th anniversary of the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank), Adesina pointed to the important role of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) in that regard, saying when fully implemented, the AfCFTA would raise the share of Intra-African trade in Africa’s total trade from 16 per cent to 52 per cent. “It would also increase the value of Africa’s traded goods and services by $35 billion per year,” he added.

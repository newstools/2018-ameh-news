The National Democratic Coalition, NADECO, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to go beyond the recognition of Chief MKO Abiola as the winner of the June 12, 1993 election and posthumously inaugurate him as president. NADECO was in the frontline for the restoration of democratic rule after the military annulled the 1993 presidential election won by Abiola. “The Nigerian State should formerly inaugurate posthumously Bashorun MKO Abiola as a President of Nigeria. “National Monument of Consequence be named after President Abiola, not for the mischievous reason of wanting to present him as a regional leader, which the attempt to utilise the University of Lagos was meant to be.” It said: “President Buhari should accept the fact that Nigeria’s prospect to genuine unity, expected growth and development can only be a reality if his government accepts the popular will being expressed by the majority of Nigerians that our country should return to Federal Constitutional Arrangement “Nigeria should stop living a lie by calling itself a federation when it is, in fact, being governed centrally.”

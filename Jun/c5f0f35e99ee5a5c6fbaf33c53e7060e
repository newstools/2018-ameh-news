The Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) has called on the Federal Government to establish additional funding windows for Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) to enhance financial access to the sector. SMEDAN Director-General, Dikko Radda, who disclosed this at the MSME Day 2018 celebration in Abuja, said government should reactivate the National Enterprise Development Fund and Export Development Fund (EDF), Private Equity, Venture capital and also strengthen Development Finance Institutions through equity injection. “There is also need for an improved funding of SMEDAN. If the agency is to achieve its lofty objectives, like its counterparts in other parts of the world, it has to be adequately funded in order to be placed at an advantage to provide incentives to MSMEs,” he said. Radda said the sector plays a pivotal role through several pathways that goes beyond employment generation. “They are growth-supporting sector that not only contribute significantly to improve living standards, but also bring substantial local capital formation and are  responsible for driving innovation and competition in developing economics. Government at all levels have undertaken initiatives to promote the growth and development of MSMEs. The general perspective is that MSMEs also play significant contribution in the transition from agriculture-led economies to industrial-led economies”.

 The National Council on Privatisation chaired by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo will today (Friday) meet to take some decisions critical to the Federal Government’s privatisation programme. Investigation shows that one of the issues to be discussed by the council, which supervises the work of the Bureau of Public Enterprises, is the appointment of transaction advisers for the commercialisation of the Nigeria Postal Services. It was learnt that some potential advisory services consultants had been shortlisted. So, the NCP would take a decision on the company that would eventually get the job of advising the government on the process of commercialising the public utility corporation. Nine companies have been jostling for the job of providing advisory services to the privatisation agency for the NIPOST transaction. It was also learnt that the council would handle the appointment of advisers for other transactions that had been slated by the BPE. These include the sale of two successor companies to the Power Holding Company of Nigeria Plc – the Yola Power Distribution Company and Afam Power Plc.

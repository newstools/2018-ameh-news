 In continuation of its quest to boost public awareness and support for the campaign against substandard products in the country, the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) recently took its nationwide sensitization exercise on the SON Act to Kano. The objective of this, according to the Director General of SON, Mr. Osita Aboloma, was to increase consumers’ awareness on the Act and how it would impact on  the organization’s pursuit of its mandate and  on businesses, and generally on Nigerians. Indeed, participants at the forum, which had two guest speakers–Alhaji Ali Madugu-Vice President, Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) and a Lecturer from Bayero University, Barrister Usman Muhammad Shu’aib Zunnrain stressed their desire for more collaboration with SON for a mutually beneficial relationship. Other dignitaries at the forum which held at the Grand Central hotel, Bompai Road, Kano included the Kano State Commissioner of Police-Rabi’u Yusuf, who was represented by Assistant Commissioner  of Police(ACP) Abubakar Zubair,  representative of the State Commandant of the Nigerian Civil Defence Corp (NCDC)  Chief Superintendent Abdulhamid Kabara, representative of the Director of the  Department of State Security Service (DSS), Alhaji Nasir Ibraheem and the Kano State Coordinator of SON in Kano and Jigawa States-Alhaji Yunusa Mohamme, who represented the Director General, Mr Osita Aboloma There were also the Managing Director, S.G International Agencies and Coordinator, Association of Nigerian Licensed Custom Agent (ANCLA)-Alhaji Mohammed Sanusi Wakili, the Chairman, Chosen Cargo Services Nigeria Limited-Sir Patrick Agbato, the Secretary, Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, Kano-Alhaji Tijani Ahmed and representative of the Nigerian Spinners & Dyers,  Kano- Engineer Haruna Musa of the Department of Mechatronics Engineering,  Bayero University, Kano. In his welcome address at the forum with the theme: “SON ACT 14, 2015: The imperative of consumer engagement”, the Director General explained that what  the SON Act was intended to achieve was to halt the prevailing situation where criminals flood the country with substandard products with impunity, largely because the previous laws under which the organization operated did not provide commensurate sanctions to offenders and deserved protection and sufficient power to SON officials. Now that the new laws have provided an enabling environment for the organization, he stated, Nigerians could be rest assured that the menace of substandard products would now be decisively dealt with and culprits instantly reprimanded, ultimately prosecuted and appropriately sanctioned. Aboloma added that faithful Implementation of the new Act would guarantee increased sales to genuine manufacturers and importers who, he noted, are presently shortchanged because of their inability to compete with cheaper substandard products which flood the nation’s markets. The DG however disclosed that there are provisions in the Act which manufacturers, importers and other stakeholders and indeed all Nigerians must know so as to ensure necessary sensitization and collaboration in the campaign against substandard products. This imperative, he explained, informed the agency’s sustained stakeholders forum, where SON, sister agencies and other partners, among others, share information and experiences and proffer suggestions on how to win the anti-substandard products battle.

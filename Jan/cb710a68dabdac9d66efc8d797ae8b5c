  The President, Association of Bureaux De Change Operators of Nigeria, Mr. Aminu Gwadabe, has said Naira’s marginal depreciation by 0.55 per cent to close at N365on Friday was part of foreign exchange market fluctuations. This came despite the frequent interventions by the Central Bank of Nigeria. Speaking to business correspondents during the weekend, Gwadabe said, “The spikes maybe as a result of the renewed political spending that is going to be a threat to naira stability; secondly, the differential exchange rates at the various official window is also discouraging genuine competition among operators which the parallel market always survived on.” The interbank window of the nation’s foreign exchange market had last Tuesday received a boost of $210m from the CBN. The interventions were made at the wholesale, the Small and Medium-scale Enterprises, and invisibles segments of the market. The Acting Director, Corporate Communications, CBN, Mr. Isaac Okorafor, had said the bank offered the sum of $100m to the wholesale segment, while the SMEs and invisibles segments received the sum of $55m each. He reiterated that the releases were meant to boost liquidity, trade and ease of remittances for legitimate personal commitments

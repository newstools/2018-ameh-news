 Member of House of Representatives, Rep. Joseph Akinlaja (Ondo-PDP), has stated that the Deputy President of the Senate, Mr Ike Ekweremadu’s wisdom saved Nigeria from greater embarrassment following Wednesday’s attack on the Senate by suspected thugs, who made away with the mace. Akinlaja told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Abuja that Ekweremadu used common sense to avert further consequences over the incident. He, however, explained that the common sense displayed by the deputy president of the senate by not forcefully ejecting Sen. Ovie Omo-Agege from the chamber was unprecedented. “If Ekweremadu had asked him to go out yesterday or forcefully pulled him out, the senate chamber would have been divided and there would have been more chaos. “By sitting inside the Senate chamber throughout the executive session and the rest of plenary showed that Omo Agege was out to disobey and confront the decision of the Senate, but the presiding officer was very wise. “He allowed it in order not to create a scene or division on the floor. You know there will be some senators who are sympathetic to Omo-Agege and some, against him. “What he did by sitting inside the senate chamber was the height of impunity,’’ Akinlaja said.

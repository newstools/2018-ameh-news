The Transition Committee set up by Ekiti State governor-elect, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, has denied instructing any bank to stop the payment of salaries of workers of the Ekiti State University (EKSU). The panel said the rumour making the round that it has given such an  order was the handiwork of mischief makers.  The Transition Committee in a statement by its secretary, Ayodeji Ajayi, said it does not have such a mandate and no instruction to that effect emanated from it. The statement reads: “The attention of JKF/APC Transition Committee has been drawn to a rumour making the round in Ekiti State University that it instructed a bank to stop the payment of salaries of staff of the university. “I wish to state that TC (Transition Committee) has no such mandate and so did not discuss such sensitive matters in any of its sittings. ”Therefore, no such instruction was issued by the Transition Committee. “Members of staff of the university are advised to ignore such rumour  and take up the matters affecting their  welfare with the management of the University. “The Committee as a stakeholder in the Ekiti project wishes to advise the university management to protect its landed properties around Oke Ila, Ado-Ekiti from spurious sale.”

 The Presidency has acknowledged that there is an audio recording in circulation, purported to be the voice of Leah Sharibu, the lone Christian girl still in boko haram captivity. Leah, it would be recalled, was abducted in February alongside others from their school in Dapchi, Yobe State but one hundred of them were later set free while five were reported to have died in captivity. Leah was, however, retained by the terrorists for allegedly failing to renounce her Christian faith. On Monday, an audio tape was published by an online medium, in which she asked President Muhammadu Buhari to have pity on her while also calling for assistance for her family. Reacting to the released audio message, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, said via his Twitter handle, @Garshehu, on Monday evening that the “secret service” was analyzing the audio. Shehu promised that the President would spare no effort to ensure all the girls in boko haram’s captivity are freed. He tweeted: “We are aware of the audio in circulation concerning the unfortunate situation of our daughter, Leah Sharibu. In dealing with terrorists, nothing is too trivial. The secret service is analyzing the voice. “Our reaction will follow the outcome of the investigation. For President Buhari, nothing will be spared in bringing all our girls home. He will not rest until all of them are freed.”

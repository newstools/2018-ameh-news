 The Senator representing Kogi West in the National Assembly, Dino Melaye, has said the International Police Organisation, INTERPOL’s refusal to place him on its watch list has vindicated him of the allegations of illegal possession of firearms and arming political thugs. A statement issued in Abuja by Gideon Ayodele, his Special Adviser on Media, reads in full: “INTERPOL has explained why it has refused to do the bidding of the Nigeria Police by placing Senator Dino Melaye on its Watch List, about a week after the Kogi State Command of the local police declared him wanted over pre-meditated and spurious allegations of illeagal possession of firearms and arming political thugs. “There is no doubt that the position of the INTERPOL validates his assertions and belief that the latest allegations against him were politically motivated by the Kogi State government and its agents, hence he has been vindicated from outside Nigeria since INTERPOL does not engage in “politically-motivated operations”. “We have earlier expressed our worry regarding the institution of the Nigeria Police becoming entangled in the Kogi political crisis and its partial involvement rather than a mediator or law enforcement agency. Perhaps the message to the local police will be more lounder now that INTERPOL has refused to be dragged into local and partisan politics in Kogi State. “We are not surprised by the INTERPOL pronouncement regarding Senator Dino Melaye because its charter forbids it, at least in theory, from undertaking interventions or activities of a political, military, religious, or racial nature or involving itself in disputes over such matters.”

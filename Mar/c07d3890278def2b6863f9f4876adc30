 First City Monument Bank is set to reward and enhance the experience of its customers through its reward scheme tagged ‘’FCMB Millionaire Promo Season 5.’’ This followed the success of the previous editions of the promo which had led the lender to rewarding over 25,000 customers with various gifts, including cars and cash ranging from N1m to N5m. In a statement, FCMB explained that the Millionaire Promo Season 5, which runs from March to October 2018, was being targeted at all segments of the society, especially existing and potential savings account customers of the bank. This, however, excluded salary and domiciliary account holders, it said. The statement read in part, “The promo has been designed to provide extra empowerment value to customers of the bank, reward them for their loyalty over the years, while also encouraging financial inclusion, the establishment of small scale businesses as well as the development of a savings culture.” Speaking about the promo, the Executive Director, Retail Banking, Mr. Olu Akanmu,  was quoted as saying, “The FCMB promo is very credible.  The draws in the coming season will still take place in all the zones of the bank across Nigeria. “Winners will be emerging from every region, spread across cities, towns and neigbourhoods all over the country. The strength of the FCMB franchise is very remarkable across Nigeria. This accounts for the millions of customers who are doing their savings and banking transactions with us, daily using all our channels. We will continue to reward our customers for their patronage. They are the reason why we are in business and we are poised to continue to serve them with excellent customer experience.’’

The High Court of Justice, Ekiti State Judicial Division siting in Ise-Ekitiunder his Lordship Hon Justice Adesodun has declared that MrSaliuBolarinwaLawal who has purported to parade himself as the Obaaji-odo of Ise-Ekiti, Ekiti State, is not a bonafide member of the Obaaji family neither is he a native of IseEkiti, and as such declared that his installation into the Obaaji-odoChieftaincy position did not follow due process and customs of the Obaaji Family.  In the final judgement reserved recently by the Court, pursuant to suit number: HIS/1/2016 filed to contest the installation of MrSaliuLawal as the Chief Obaaji-odo of Ise-Ekiti by HRH Oba AyodeleAdetunjiAjayi, the Arinjale of Ise-Ekiti, theObaaji-odo family through their representatives contested against five defendants on the case namely the same HRH Oba AyodeleAdetunjiAjayi, MrSaliuBolarinwaLawal and three others; the court in its judgement granted all the nine prayers of the Obaaji family which include a declaration that MrSaliuLawal’s occupation of the Chieftaincy stool was not only illegal but also ordered him to vacate same forthwith.  As the news of the judgement broke into town, it was observed that the Obaaji family largely within the Iereke area and the Ise-Ekititownship and its environs were full of excitement. One of the excited youth, Mr Femi Adeyemigave his views, “The town is now relievedafter the judgement; everyone knew that the wrong that was done to the Obaaji family by the installation of the wrong person will not stand for long. The court has done well by having the courage to speak the truth.”MrAdeyemi said.  It is worthy of note that the Chieftaincy title, the Obaaji-odo of Ise-Ekiti that was disputed since 2016 before the Court, is the most important traditional chieftaincy in Ise-Ekiti because the position is the second-in-command to the Traditional ruler, the Arinjale of Ise-Ekiti. The Obaaji-odoof Ise-Ekitiis not just a high ranking traditional position, it is also the Head of IwarafaMefa, the Kingmakers of the ancientIse-Ekiti town. The last legitimate occupant of the high ranking traditional stool was the late High Chief Samuel Ibiyinka Abiodun who died in September 2010 after his 39years reign. Ise-Ekiti is an ancient town being one of the original sixteen kingdoms of Ekitiland, and since the mordern Nigeria, the headquarters of Ise-Orun Local Governement Area, located within the South senatorial district of Ekiti State, South-West Nigeria.  Ise-Ekiti shares boundary with other popular towns like Ado-Ekiti (Ekiti State capital), Emure-Ekiti and Ikere-Ekiti.

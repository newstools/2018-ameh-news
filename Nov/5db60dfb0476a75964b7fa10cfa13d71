The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) is set to recover 200 containers auctioned by the Nigeria  Customs Service (NCS) outside the ports, its Managing Director, Usman Mohammed, has assured. He said the containers were filled with power equipment imported from abroad, adding that TCN is convinced that the containers would be recovered soon, and thereafter taken to where they are needed for the growth of the sector. In a statement, Mohammed said TCN has recovered 693 out of over 800 containers that were brought into the country by the previous governments, in order to improve power generation, distribution and transmission. He said the containers were stranded at various ports, due to the failure of the past government to pay the necessary charges on them. He said: “TCN has been able to recover 693 out of over 800 containers, that were imported by the government and scattered around the countries. Some of these containers are in various ports for more than fifteen years. “ Some of the containers have been auctioned by the officials of the NCS and we have to trace the auctioneers, with a view to getting the containers back. The government is supporting TCN in order to recover  the containers, and I know that as the government have beamed its searchlight on the distribution companies, they are going to solve the problems in the distribution companies, by helping them to get the facilities they need for operation, including the power containers that are missing.” According to him, the government was set to solve the problems in the distribution arm of the sector, adding that modalities have been put in place to address the crises besetting the growth of the industry. In a related development, the Minister of Power, Housing and Works, Mr Babatunde Raji Fashola, said the Federal Government is committed to the provision of equipment needed to ensure steady power supply.

The Kaduna State Government has disbursed N20 million soft loan to women entrepreneurs in Kaduna Central Senatorial District, North-West Nigeria. The Commissioner for Women Affairs and Social Development, Hajiya Hafsat Baba, said during the disbursement of the soft loan that 504 women benefited from the initiative in the zone. According to her, the effort was part of the state government’s social investment program to lift women out of poverty and encourage self-reliance. She said that the beneficiaries received between N250, 000 and N100, 000 after thorough screening to ensure that the women are running small scale businesses: “If you empower women economically you are empowering the nation and we don’t want to see our women begging, we need to empower our people, “We don’t want to actually share the money, we want to build on their capital to strengthen their businesses.” The wife of state governor, Hadiza El-Rufa’I, urged the women to make judicious use of the money. Also, the running mate of Gov. Nasiru El-Rufa’i in the 2019 elections, Dr Hadiza Abubakar urged the beneficiaries to repay the loan on time. Meanwhile, the Emir of Zazzau Dr Shehu Idris, commended the state government for the initiative to support women in the state. The Emir, who was represented by the District Head of Kawo, Alhaji Jibril, encouraged the beneficiaries to utilize the loan to boost their businesses. According to source, the state government plans to disburse N200 million to women running small scale businesses across the state to enhance local economy.

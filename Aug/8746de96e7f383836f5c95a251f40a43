How a Sifax Group Company took flight from a shipping company with an expansion into the Maritime, Aviation, Haulage, Logistics, Oil & Gas, and Hospitality, among others sectors of economy.  In Keynote address at the 3rd Taiwo Afolabi Annual Maritime Conference, Barrister (DR) Taiwo Afolabi, the Group Executive Chairman, Sifax Group, said, I am specifically happy as Chief Host that the Forum has gathered all of us together here as critical stakeholders, to discuss a major issue that is of enduring relevance to us either as players or as final consumers of the products brought into the Nigerian market principally by global and international maritime trade.  This year’s edition of the 3rd Taiwo Afolabi Annul Maritime Conference, orrganised in my honour by the Maritime Forum, held in University of Lagos’ Auditorium, on Friday, August 17, 2018.  In Dr Afolabi’s words: This is major reason I consider this year’s topic Port Costs and Port Charges: A Recurring Decimal Under Port Reform Regime, a particularly apt topic, one that is guaranteed to generated a lot of heat considering the conflicting interests of the individual corporate players in the industry.  “As an industry player myself, I expect the intellectual discourse and analysis from veterans such as are here gathered today to also generate enough light that will help to shape necessary policy formulations by the regulatory authorities, to the maximum satisfaction of majority of industry players, which include the federal government, port concessionairies and other operators, shippers and other users well as the general final consumers of the Nigerian port system.”  Barrister Afolabi who was represented at the event by his daughter, Mariam Afolabi said “By what percentage will the cost of services be adjusted upward to reflect the astronomical changes in the foreign exchange regime as at today?  “We are convinced that these are matters of immediate and practical concern to every Nigerian, and more so to the regulatory authorities who need to harmonise and balance the conflicting viewpoints to the satisfaction of the stakeholders.

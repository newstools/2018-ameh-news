 Senate President Bukola Saraki and Plateau State Goveror Simon Lalong yesterday spoke of the need to change the nation’s security structure to stem killings. They spoke during Saraki’s visit to the governor to condole with him over last weekend’s killings of villagers and farmers by suspectd herdsmen. The Plateau attacks are the latest by the herdsmen, whose deadly activities have led to mass deaths, mainly in Benue, Taraba, Nasarawa and Kogi states. “Something is wrong; unless we want to deceive ourselves. It might not have started today but let us sit down at a table and find a solution to it. He praised the governor’s efforts to stop the killings. Saraki, however, advised  Lalong to be fair and just in governing the people, saying that God would be on his side to guide him if he does what is right. Saraki said the National Assembly would, through its oversight function, ensure that whatever was required to stem the killings was done. Lalong said: “I agree with you that we need new security architecture because if we allow people to be killed before we look for the reasons that they were killed, it is unfortunate. “It is better that they must be proactive, know what is coming and take action before it happens.” According to him, before he left for the APC national convention, he interacted with security chiefs and community leaders and there was no tension or cause to worry. He said shortly after they began to announce results, he was informed that his state was on fire and he immediately left the convention to rush back home. “We are doing our best to ensure that the crisis doesn’t spread to other parts of state,” Lalong assured.

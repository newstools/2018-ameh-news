 President Muhammadu Buhari has commended the Government of Thailand and international volunteers in the current efforts to rescue 12 children and their coach trapped in a cave for more than two weeks, with imminent risks of starvation and death. Reacting to ongoing rescue efforts which are already yielding positive results, President Buhari said Thailand has inspired other developing nations that, despite limited resources, a people can achieve success through their efforts towards emergency response. ”In a globalised world, the bond of our common humanity is getting stronger day by day. Although Thailand is located thousands of miles away from us, we in Nigeria share the pains and difficulties of these trapped teenagers who face imminent danger to their lives. “The way the international community responded with empathy and enthusiasm, is evidence that our common humanity is greater than our differences. When we perceive the victims as our own children, we are bound to identify with the trapped kids and be moved to action,” the President said. President Buhari is greatly inspired by the response of the Thai government to the crisis; and the dedication and enthusiasm of the rescue teams.

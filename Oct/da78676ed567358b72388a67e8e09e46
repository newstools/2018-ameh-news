The management has published September 2018 results, with EPS growth of 16% y/y and 80% q/q to NGN1.99 in Q3-2018.  In the Q3 or 9 months of the year, the bank’s profit has grown by 12% y/y to N144.18 bn in 2018.
The 1% y/y uptick in Q3-2018’s gross earnings was largely on the back of the 11% growth in interest income to N110.39 billion. Interest earned on customer loans (+8.35% y/y) and government securities (+44% y/y) were major drivers of the increase in interest income.  On the other hand, decline in fees & commission income (-30% y/y, -10% q/q) led to a disappointing NIR (-18% y/y, -37% q/q) performance in the quarter. Over the 9 months period, NIR dropped 20%, with trading income, other income, and fees and commission income all recording respective negative growth of 35%, 24%, and 1%.  Total impairment charges in the quarter was relatively flat, as it dipped 0.79% y/y. Together with a 9% decline in gross customer loans, annualized cost of risk for the period printed at 0.93% (vs. 2.8% in Q3-2017), according to our estimates. It is also worth stating that gross loans dipped further by 2%, compared to H1-2018, amidst continued paydown by obligors.  The cost to income (CTI) ratio for the quarter inched up 200 bps y/y to 45%, but was much lower than the 53% (-900 bps) recorded in H1-2018, amidst a 7% y/y increase and 22% q/q decrease in Q3-2018 opex.  It is worth stating that the bank recorded a tax credit of N2.5 billion in Q3 in 2018, owing to deferred tax asset recognition in tax expenses during the period. Further clarification on the item will be obtained upon our meeting with management. Nonetheless, the tax credit gave the boost to the bank’s earnings, as pre-tax profit was down 0.7% y/y in the quarter.

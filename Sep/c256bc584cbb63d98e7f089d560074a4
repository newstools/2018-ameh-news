The Nigeria Customs Service has stressed the need for the management of the Nigeria Ports Authority (NPA) to involve customs operatives in the opening of its jetties. Mr Gbenga Idris, an Assistant Customs Comptroller (CAC) in charge of Enforcement, Onne Command, Rivers, made the appeal in an interview with newsmen. Idris insisted that the influx of some contraband could be traced to some entry points where customs operatives were not manning. The officer spoke against the backdrop of the NPA’s announcement on the establishment of private jetties to ease transaction at ports. Idris said that “it is pertinent for the Nigeria Ports Authority, whose purview is to establish jetties, to get security concerns from security formations before embarking on such venture. “We cannot sacrifice the security of the country on the basis of ease of doing business. “Some of these jetties could pose security threats, especially if the security operatives’ angel is not considered before establishing them. “Our country is currently facing security challenges. It will be a disservice if such is compounded, based on trade facilitation.’’ The NPA has 246 jetties operating in the country in different facets of the nation maritime sector.

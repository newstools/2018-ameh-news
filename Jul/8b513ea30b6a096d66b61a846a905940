The House of Representatives has ordered the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to immediately begin the withdrawal of all mutilated naira notes from banks across the country. The House urged the apex bank to replace the mutilated notes — particularly the N100 note — with new ones. It also mandated its Committee on Banking and Currency to investigate black-marketing of mint naira notes on the streets. The resolutions were sequel to a motion on the need to investigate the sale of the mint naira notes and sources of black-marketing of the naira introduced during yesterday plenary by Adekoya Abdel-Majid from Ogun State. The lawmaker said the naira now appears in “inglorious” forms and “with odours that can be dangerous to human health.” He said the naira notes in circulation, especially N100, are “badly torn, terribly squeezed, soiled, cello taped, dirty and mutilated. “Considering that bacteria naturally breed and live in dirty environments and objects, dirty naira notes could pose serious health risks as they have been found to contain pathogenic parasites and bacteria.

The Nigerian-British Chamber of Commerce (NBCC) is promoting trade and investment opportunities between Nigeria and the United Kingdom (UK). The NBCC has therefore concluded plans to lead a trade mission to the UK where business concerns from both countries will be discussed. The group said it will provide platform for Nigerian and British businesses to  collaborate so as to encourage, promote and facilitate trade and investments between the two nations. Speaking at the pre-mission briefing in Lagos, NBCC President, Akin Olawore, said the five-day mission scheduled from June 11 will feature a series of business to business meetings with prospective partners from various British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), key policy influencers and Nigerians in Diaspora. Olawore said delegates will have the opportunity to participate at the international business festival in Liverpool and the London Technology Week with a working conference themed: “The Ease of doing business in Nigeria- A sound Check” included to hold at the Institute of Director, Pall mall, London. On volume of trade between the countries, he said the volume of trade is improving due to increase in business from both countries, adding that more will be achieved as trade relations improve and wrong narratives dealt with through accurate information dissemination.

 The Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, on Wednesday said the Tuesday sacking of Mr. Lawal Daura as the Director-General of the Department of State Services was a unanimous decision. He said there was no way the Acting President, Yemi Osinbajo, would have taken the decision without unanimity with President Muhammadu Buhari who is currently on vacation. Adesina gave the explanation while answering questions from State House correspondents at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. He said since there was no power tussle between the two leaders, he expected that the decision would be a unanimous one. The presidential spokesman added that Osinbajo, being a decent man, would have done the needful before taking the decision. He reiterated his position that the Presidency remains one. Adesina said, “What we will like to say for the umpteenth time is that the Presidency is one. “Whenever the President is proceeding on vacation, he transmits power to the Vice President, who then becomes the Acting President. On this occasion, he also did that. So, the acting President has all the powers of a President. “Now, it is a matter of decency and we know that the acting President is a decent man. There is no tussle for power, there is no tough battle between him and the President. “When something like what happened yesterday (Tuesday) will happen, there will be unanimity. “There is no way there won’t be unanimity on that kind of decision. It is not something that will be discussed with the press, but know that there was unanimity in the decision.”

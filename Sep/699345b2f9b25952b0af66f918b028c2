President Muhammadu Buhari has condemned the killing of an aid worker who was kidnapped about six months ago in Rann, Borno State, by members of the boko haram terrorists group. The aid worker, Saifura Hussaini Ahmed Khorsa, was said to have been kidnapped at the Rann camp for internally displaced persons. In a statement he issued on Monday night, the President also condemned the terrorists’ threat to harm others, including the lone Dapchi school girl, Leah Sharibu still in their custody. The statement said, “The government of Nigeria strongly condemns this reprehensible and inhuman act. No religion permits the killing of the innocent. Saifura worked for the Red Cross, a humanitarian organisation working to bring succour to all the victims of violence irrespective of the sides of the conflict.” International Partners
The President also appealed to Nigeria’s international partners and everyone with an influence on the terrorists to prevail on them “to stop these acts of extreme barbarism.” He said his administration would seize every given opportunity, with both hands and use all means available to bring home all citizens held against their will by the boko haram terrorists. President Buhari extended condolences to the family of Saifura, the Red Cross and UNICEF over the loss of this selfless and hardworking mother.

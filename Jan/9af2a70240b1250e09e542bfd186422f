 The Executive Chairman of Federal Inland Revenue Service, Mr. Babatunde Fowler, on Tuesday in Kano, said there was no hiding place for tax evaders, who had refused to seize the opportunity provided by the Voluntary Asset and Income Declaration Scheme to pay appropriate taxes. In a keynote address at a training workshop for professionals advising clients on participation in the VAIDS, Fowler described the scheme as a tax amnesty programme, which taxpayers were expected to take advantage of this, he said, was in view of the time limited opportunities given to defaulters to voluntarily come forward to regularise their tax status in consideration of certain incentives given by the government. Fowler stated that the VAID was targeted at every taxpayer, who had unlawfully underpaid or not paying by any means, adding that the scheme would run till March 31, 2018. During the period, it will provide opportunities for taxpayers to regularise their status relating to previous tax periods by honestly declaring previously undisclosed assets and incomes.

Uber has announced a strategic partnership with the Lagos State Employment Trust Fund to create business and economic opportunities for riders on Uber platform. According to the partners, the initiative tagged ‘UBERPITCH’ creates opportunities for entrepreneurs to pitch their ideas, learn from highly successful business leaders and potentially get capital to effectively run their business. Commenting on the partnership, the Uber General Manager for West Africa, Lola Kassim, said, “In line with Uber’s clear commitment to Africa and our goal of continually creating business and economic opportunities for all, the UBERPITCH campaign sees us supporting entrepreneurs by creating a platform for them to pitch ideas, leverage relevant advice from business mentors and potentially receive capital from the Lagos State Employment Trust Fund to run their businesses. Our partnership with the LSETF indicates that we are focused on ensuring that these entrepreneurs build viable and successful businesses.” Speaking on the initiative and the collaboration with Uber, the Executive Secretary/CEO of the LSETF, Akintunde Oyebode, said, “The LSETF’s mandate of job creation by supporting entrepreneurship and employability is a vision we share with Uber. Since its inception two years ago, the LSETF has provided funding worth N6bn to 8,000 businesses; and trained over 3,000 unemployed Lagos residents, with a view to placing them in jobs. Through these activities, the Fund has enabled jobs for over 25,000 people, improved the productivity of small businesses state-wide, and ensured Lagos State remains on a path of sustainable economic growth.” Sharing additional details on the UBERPITCH campaign, the Country Marketing Lead for Uber in West Africa, Margaret Banasko, said, “The campaign is divided into two phases. The first phase is where Uber riders who run tech-enabled businesses submit or pitch their ideas; and shortlisted candidates stand the chance of winning workspace vouchers of up to N1.8m.”

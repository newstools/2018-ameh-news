Babajide Sanwo Olu in Action Lagos State Gubernatorial aspirant under the All Progressive Congress (APC), Babajide Sanwo Olu has faulted the participation of federal government over inland waterways activities in the country. Sanwo Olu in an exclusive interview (Uhuru Times), said activities of inland waterways should be an exclusive right of the state adding that the apex tier of government cannot monitor or control activities of the waterways effectively. He said inland waterways operations are quite different from what is obtainable from commercial or merchant shipping. “I believe the Federal Government is sitting on too many responsibilities it should not concern itself with. “We all say that politics is local, economy too is local. Let us be real, we need to have our boots on the ground. “We need to understand that when the local economy thrives, it can galvanise and drive the national economy. He further reiterated that “Our revenue allocation formula should be made more favourable to the states. The APC aspirant further added that “The Federal Government does not even know what happens on these inland waterways, yet there is an agency of Federal Government in charge of this “Some agencies of Federal Government should be controlled by states. They are things states should do. “The Federal Government for example has an Inland Waterways Authority. I cannot understand why the Federal Government should control Inland Waters. Inland water, from Badagry to Epe, is not the sea or shipping routes. “The inland waterways are for canoes and passenger boats, for people to make a living. “These are critical conversations we should be having with ourselves. We must be truthful to ourselves on these issues. Let me say again, I will be for state police and restructuring,”

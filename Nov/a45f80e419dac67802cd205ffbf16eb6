The House of Representatives committee on Maritime is investigating 12 foreign shipping firms’ local agents accused of diverting $300 million due to the Federal Government  for their own use.  Some of the companies  have however denied the allegation of wholesale indebtedness to government for which they are currently being investigated by the House from 2004 till date. The firms under scrutiny are GAC, Daddo Maritime Services, Blue Sea, Divine Marine, Transoceanic support services, Inchcape shipping and Maersk. Others are AlRaine, Hull Blyth CMA CGM- Delmas, Joe Eboje and Peak shipping. In their presentations, those who appeared before the panel like, Gac, Inch Cape, faulted the amounts allegedly owed Nigeria Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA0. From the $172 million, Gac claimed it is owing less than $5million. It was the same position canvassed by Inch Cape and Hull Blyth. They claimed that the figures before the committee did not represent what they owe, since reconciliation of figures was continuous. The House Committee on Maritime had raised alarm over how foreign shipping companies’ local agents are shortchanging the Federal government of revenue to the tune of over $300 million. House Committee on Maritime Safety, Education and Administration, investigating allegations of non remittance and ill practices by the shipping companies, said this at the investigative hearing in Abuja. The committee said so much monies amounting to $300million from three per cent levy they collected on behalf of NIMASA, from international shipping companies had been diverted.
